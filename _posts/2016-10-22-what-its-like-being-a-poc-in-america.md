Yesterday, someone told my dad he'd take pleasure in sending his ass back to his home "in Mexico or wherever", while someone else told him he was a threat  to his kids so he should leave and not come back.

My 9 year old brother was in the car while during this incident, and I asked him how he felt about the incident. He responded with an innocent "I dunno." All he really understood was that my other people "ganged up" on him (his words) and that my dad got a bit upset.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, hearing how my mom or cousins would get discriminated against for wearing Hijab, or how my dad had to deal with people not taking him seriously because of his immigrant status. I was always confused when I heard this, but it never made me mad. It was just *weird*. Like why does that happen? My kiddy brain just wrote them off as anomalies -- People are weird, and sometimes that weirdness makes them say mean things. Not a big deal, right?

I got bullied a bit in school growing up. And I was really sensitive (still am), so even standard juvenile put-downs would really hurt me. My mom would always tell me, "Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt me." So, growing up, I applied the same logic to racism. As I learned to  assume and accept that adolescents just said mean things sometimes, I learned to normalize racism. They're just words. They're weird, and kind of hurtful, but hey, they don't actually *mean* anything if I ignore it, right?

Now, as I grow up, I have to recontextualize these experiences. As I learn about America's deep and elaborate history with racism, I realize there is a whole **structure** behind these seemingly common occurrences. These conflicts aren't just "people acting weird", they are influenced by hundred of years of xenophobia and white supremacy. And more importantly, these conflicts have real consequences. Sure, my dad's co-worker subtly implying he's not pulling his weight doesn't seem to hurt anyone. But when this mindset affects the rest of the office's view of him, and it shows on his performance reviews, it all of a sudden becomes very real.

And so, I've realized that racism if often subtle and passive, but it also can very easily become why you can't put food on the table for your family. And the biases that cause that co-worker to not take my dad seriously because he's an immigrant are the same biases that causes employers to reject perfectly qualified people of color, that make predominantly white professions feel excluded to POC, and that reinforce unequal race segregation and gentrification in districts, cities, or even neighborhoods.

It's weird digesting this, because this new context forces me to redefine my experiences with race and take it out of the vacuum I originally placed it in. And it's odd because I actually get **mad** about it now.

I get mad because it's just so absurd. I get mad because why does my dad have to deal with accusations of being illegal when he's lived in America twice as long as he has in Pakistan? Because why does my family have to worry about not belonging when my dad teaches university students CS here, when my mom takes care of terminally ill patients and their families at the hospital, when my brothers take fencing classes and play at the local center?

And why, when my dad was treated so unfairly, is his reaction questioned first, instead of the blatant racism? He was called an illegal Mexican and a threat, but is he getting upset now evidence that he deserves it? And why did no one say anything when it happened? Why are there 10 times as many skeptics who "don't know the full story" or "especially feel bad for the shopkeepers" as there are people who want to actually work to deconstruct these instances of racism? And God, why are there so many people who are willing to disapprove of explicit racism like this, but once you ask for help in creating institutional change, they accuse you of being a socialist? As if this racism is just a "thing", something that sucks, but you know, what are you gonna do? Especially since calling people out, raising awareness, and protesting are "buzzkills" and "too disruptive". As if we should just ignore a system that propagates violence and discrimination against POC on the daily. As if peace and quiet for the privileged is more important than justice for the oppressed.

You know, I've gotten good, so good, at acting nice, at laying low, at being the Good Muslimâ„¢, but why is it my responsibility to change how I act because of a system that oppresses me? Why is it that after every single incident of racism, POC have to process their feelings of being unsafe and unwanted, support those affected, organize and raise awareness, and convince all the skeptics that this isn't our fault and we don't deserve this -- all at the ***same goddamn time***?

You know, my brothers take their fencing classes right next door to that store that persecuted my dad. I remember the pictures my mom sent me of them fencing - I was so proud of them because my brothers aren't particularly athletic and they finally found a sport they really enjoyed and wanted to get better at. And it made me happy, because I would always quit after the first class of any new hobby, but my brothers decided to stick with this. But now, I have to think about their safety. I have to consider: What if my dad is recognized when picking up my brothers and something happens? What if someone connects my innocent 9 year old brother to something he doesn't even understand? What if my brothers have to drop fencing for their safety? Like it's freaking fencing! In what kind of world does racism affect such trivial things as trying to learn fencing?? It's just so absurd, man.

We just want to live. Why is that so hard?
