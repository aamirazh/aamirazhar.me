I sit in my room alone, listening to a special playlist of mine. I name my playlists very intricately, in order to describe the emotion the songs within facilitate in me. It's a triangle of interaction -- The raw emotion which can never be described wholly, the music that describes that feeling, and its name.

Sometimes I create a playlist name that describes an emotion so perfectly, and accurately, like this one. But, each of these playlists is only perfect because of what those words, those songs, and that emotion are to me. It seems that the more perfect my playlist names seem to be, the harder they'd be to explain and share to someone else. Generally, the more intricately I recognize my feelings, the harder it is to share. Why does it have to be that way?

Why is it that the deeper I feel something, the harder it is to explain? Why is it that the closer I get to sensing life's essence, the further I feel from others? Why are my emotions so strongly directed inward, while my need to express myself is directed outward?

I constantly cycle through feeling profound, inexplicable feelings, then trying to express them somehow, and then falling short. My lifelong struggle is figuring out how to share the infinities I know in myself, to extract the abstract, to humanize the divine. Maybe even, one day, I could feel these infinities with someone else, instead of only with myself.

But is that impossible? Is the nature of communication such that it can never completely capture personal nuance? I remember my first English class in 11th grade, where my teacher explained that language is imperfect. That when you say something, there are the words you use to describe it, and the pure idea of what you're trying to express. He made the words the numerator, and the idea the denominator, and explained that the fraction never equals one. What this means is that the language you use to describe a pure idea will never ever fulfill or completely express that pure idea. There's always a gap, a lag, an imperfection. To express in a medium that must be common between people is to starve that which is special. To package the divine into a structure is to mortalize it. To define the infinity is to make it finite.

Does this mean I'll live my whole life unsatisfied? Unsatisfied because I have felt such deep, yet such nuanced emotion, but no one else can truly understand it? Unsatisfied because I can never express exactly what I feel? Unsatisfied because there are things that only I can experience?

Every year, I make progress. Every month, every week, every day. Every new hobby, every new way of expressing myself, every new relationship, they help me discover how to express myself more genuinely. And through expressing myself, it helps me further understand my infinities. It's like each method of expressing myself is a language, and every time I try to express an infinity through that language, I feel like I can grasp it better.

But, it's neverending. It's a marathon of infinities -- Though each step feels so large, I feel no closer to my destination. It just seems so futile, sometimes. Like I'm so far away from being able to externally express how I feel inside, and that can be so frustrating.

Reaching the destination would be pure enlightenment, but what if I actually got there? What would I actually do? If, by just using common, shared mediums, I'd be able to express that which I only know to myself? But, what then?

Maybe the beauty in life is not reaching the divine. Maybe it's continuing to press each step in that marathon, knowing I'll never reach the end. It's cherishing the ability to make progress, despite being fundamentally bounded. It's accepting our limitations and working within them.

So, no matter what, I'll keep trying. I'll embrace our finiteness, our mortality, our fallibility. I'll accept the limitations of the mediums we use to communicate, while still pushing their boundaries. I'll attempt to express the inexpressible time and time again, despite failure.

And maybe, just maybe, every once in a while, I would be able to see that infinity briefly. Maybe I could catch a glimpse of the divine.
