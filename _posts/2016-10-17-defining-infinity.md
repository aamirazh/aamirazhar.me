It’s another late night, my computer screen glowing against the darkness of an unlit room and a pitch black outdoors. I sit still in my chair, alone, headphones playing a special playlist of mine, one titled “i am no longer of this world”. I name my playlists meticulously in order to properly describe the emotion the songs spark within me. It’s a triangle of interaction: the raw, abstract emotion, the music that stimulates the feeling, and the name I assign to it.

Sometimes I create a playlist name that describes an emotion so beautifully, and accurately.  These titles are meaningful because of what those words, those songs, and that emotion mean to me. But it seems that the more apt my playlist names seem to be, the more arduous they are to explain and share with others. The words “heavy tears of happiness”, “drowning revive”, even the text face “B\|”, simply wouldn’t make as much intuitive sense to someone else as they do to me. 

Generally, the more accurately I represent my feelings to myself, the harder it is to transmit to others. Why does it have to be that way? Why is it that the deeper I feel something, the harder it is to explain? Why is it that every step that brings me closer to sensing life’s essence takes me further from showing others? Why are my emotions so strongly directed inward, while my desire to express myself is so strongly directed outward?
There are two things I love in life: exploring my feelings and expressing them, both of which appear so distant from each other. I often feel profound, inexplicable emotions, and when I attempt to express them somehow—through carefully crafted words and phrases dripping with emotion—I would find that others still don’t entirely understand, that my words fall short of depicting my feelings and ideas.

Reflecting after a deep conversation or life-changing event, experiencing a panic attack, listening to a song or watching a film that touches me—these experiences evoke heavy emotion in me, emotion I call “infinity” because it’s a concept that is endlessly large, yet somehow condensed into an essence, represented by just one symbol or word. Mathematical frameworks work almost effortlessly with infinity, as if it isn’t an unimaginable quantity. Similarly, when I feel a great fire within me, my emotions feel larger than life, yet they remain inside me. They’re bigger than me: formless, boundless, and profound, yet humble, real, and simple at once.

My lifelong struggle has been discovering how to share these infinities I know in myself. I want to learn how to extract the abstract, how to humanize the divine. And I wonder if maybe one day, I could feel some of these infinities with someone else. If I could somehow experience an ‘internal’ infinity with an ‘external’ being.

But is that impossible? Is the nature of communication such that it can never entirely capture that personal nuance? I very fondly remember a lecture in 11th grade English where my teacher explained that language is imperfect. That when you say something, there are the words you use to describe it, and the pure idea of what you’re trying to express. On our dull, pale whiteboard, he wrote “words” as the numerator, and “idea” as the denominator, and explained that the fraction never reaches one. The language you use to describe a pure idea will never fulfill or completely express it. There’s always a gap, a lag, an imperfection. To express in a medium that must be common between people is to starve that which is special. To package the divine into a structure is to mortalize it. To define infinity is to make it finite.

Does this mean I’ll live my whole life unfulfilled? Unfulfilled because I feel such deep, such tortuous emotion, yet no one else may truly feel it, nor may I grasp what they go through? Unsatisfied because I can never quite express exactly how I feel as my experiences—or rather, my unique perception of my experiences—remain limited to myself?

Either way, I push on towards infinity. I place myself in vulnerable spaces and pursue deep relationships, despite discomfort or heartbreak, in order to learn how better to connect with others. I constantly work on improving my writing, despite frustration or setbacks, in order to express my ideas clearer and more profoundly. I devour art—films, books, albums, paintings—to uncover the common threads that run under us all. With each inch of growth, I discover how to share myself more genuinely and comprehend more of my infinities, bringing me closer to fathoming the unknown.

But I still fall short. I still feel the inadequacy after sharing or performing a vulnerable piece of mine that I notice couldn’t quite touch anyone else. I still experience the hopelessness when I pour my heart out and end up giving the listener more burden than fervor. I know the crushing disappointment when I present my most intricate passions and griefs—brought from trauma, from profound love, maybe from God himself—and I am met with nothing more than a sympathetic, blank, almost confused look.

This formidable challenge seemingly has no end, but maybe that’s where its beauty lies. Maybe the meaning arises from cherishing the process of progress despite being fundamentally bounded, by accepting our limitations and working within them.

So, no matter what, I will continue moving forward, never ceasing in my quest for the stars. I will continue to reach for infinity despite finiteness, embracing my mortality and fallibility. I will continue to push the boundaries of the limited mediums we use to communicate, and I won’t stop trying to express the inexpressible, through frustrating failure and temporary triumph alike.

And perhaps, every once in a while, we may witness that infinity rise amongst the chaos. Maybe we can catch a glimpse of the divine.
