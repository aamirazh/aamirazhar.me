**Five minute free-write - must use all five words (one word provided from each writer)**

*Words to use: contrast, barrel, sand, depth, body*

It feels like sand falling through my fingers. It feels like cold water easing through my chest and stomach. It feels like my body falling from the sky in a dream I have yet to wake up from. It feels like oil leaking from a barrel and tears brushing against my cheeks.

In this dream state, a temporary world of skies and clouds and heavens, I sit and wonder how to love without letting go. I think, *I want to be better. I want to commit without being attached. I want to fall without losing myself. I want to jump â€” I want to jump so high that no one can see me, I want to visit the clouds and my dreams and everything that can and has been, and then I want to return to the Earth gently, with no broken bones, and see that nothing has changed. Where everything exists in its incompleteness, its contrast and toxicity, beauty oozing out of it like sand or water; like oil or gravity.*
