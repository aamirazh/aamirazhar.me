I dreamt of sandpaper. Is that what it’s like? Does it feel like agony and loss, like clutching a hand that’s dead—Aamir, it’s dead; it won’t love you back. It can’t. It will only slip away, awkwardly, politely, as you beg its fingers to interlock with yours, as you cry, wailing, growling, why? Why don’t you want me?

Why—how—do I dream of something I’ve never felt? Sandpaper, clouds, and old, decayed brown brick. I’ve forgotten what I’ve known, and in its place, I reminisce on what has never been. I fill in these empty spaces—suppressed trauma, forgotten touch, unattainable ecstacy—with, with **sandpaper**. Sandpaper and fucking bricks. Heavy, heavy iron and ugly, dead plants.

I feel this tension. Do you feel it too? It’s a slippery kind of tension, like two fat, wet seals sumo wrestling, like passing someone on a narrow, poorly maintained sidewalk in Queens or Manhattan.

Everything feels opposed. Everyone stands straight up. They’re armed, and they’re watching me. I am presenting something to them. I am performing, and they are watching me. Everyone is watching me, and they all feel different. They hate each other. They doubt me. They will argue once this is all finished. I will eavesdrop like a child. I will hide like the little boy I am.

Everyone, gather round and watch me stumble. Watch me forget my lines and hold the wrong note. I will never be good enough, but the tension will make me better. Yes, yes, it will make me better, and I will use it.

Dialectic or masochistic?

Exhausting or exhilarating?

Futile or fundamental?

Follow me, and I will find clarity. Rub against me, like you are sandpaper, and I will find layers. I will evolve and grow, I will yell, I will cry and I will understand.

Give me all of it.

Sandpaper.

Brick.

Collision.

Steel.

Trauma.
