the ash never clears

their blood never dries

yet we live like it will

yes, we live through these lies

<br>
we still try to fight

then stop, sigh, and leave

cause we choose to be fed

'fore we choose to be free

<br>
we already lost

least that's how we fight

will we give up and fade?

or will we realize our rights?
