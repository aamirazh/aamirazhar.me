،في القدس، أَعني داخلَ السُّور القديمِ

In Jerusalem, I mean, inside the ancient walls

أَسيرُ من زَمَنٍ إلى زَمَنٍ بلا ذكرى

I walk between eons without a memory <sup>1</sup>

تُصوِّبُني. فإن الأنبياءَ هناك يقتسمون

to set my sights. For if the prophets there can share <sup>2</sup>

تاريخَ المقدَّس... يصعدون إلى السماء

such history of the divine… soaring to the heavens <sup>3</sup>

ويرجعون أَقلَّ إحباطاً وحزناً، فالمحبَّةُ

and returning less depressed and sorrowful, as love

.والسلام مُقَدَّسَان وقادمان إلى المدينة

and peace, so sacred, are coming to this town.

كنت أَمشي فوق مُنْحَدَرٍ وأَهْجِسُ: كيف

I was walking downhill, contemplating: how

يختلف الرُّواةُ على كلام الضوء في حَجَرٍ؟

do the storytellers disagree on the light’s word in stone? <sup>4</sup>

أَمِنْ حَجَر ٍشحيحِ الضوء تندلعُ الحروبُ؟

Is it from a meager rock that light erupts in war? <sup>5</sup>

أسير في نومي. أَحملق في منامي. لا

I walk in my sleep. I stare in my dreams. I don’t

.أرى أحداً ورائي. لا أرى أَحداً أمامي

see anyone behind me. I don’t see anyone before me.

كُلُّ هذا الضوءِ لي. أَمشي. أخفُّ. أطيرُ

All this light is for me. I walk. I am lighter. I fly. <sup>6</sup>

<br>
ثم أَصير غيري في التَّجَلِّي. تنبُتُ

Then I become something other than me, incarnated. Sprout, <sup>7</sup>

الكلماتُ كالأعشاب من فم أشعيا

the words, like grass from Isaiah’s mouth

.النِّبَويِّ: ((إنْ لم تُؤْمنوا لن تَأْمَنُوا))

The Prophet: “If you don’t believe me you are not protected.” <sup>8</sup>

أَمشي كأنِّي واحدٌ غيْري. وجُرْحي وَرْدَةٌ

I walk like I was someone besides myself; my wound a rose

بيضاءُ إنجيليَّةٌ. ويدايَ مثل حمامتَيْنِ

white and biblical. And my hands are like two doves

.على الصليب تُحلِّقان وتحملان الأرضَ

on the cross, flying and carrying the earth.

لا أمشي، أَطيرُ، أَصيرُ غَيْري في

I don’t walk, I fly, I become something other than myself in

التجلِّي. لا مكانَ و لا زمان . فمن أَنا؟

this incarnation. There is no place or time. So who am I?

أَنا لا أنا في حضرة المعراج. لكنِّي

I am not I in the presence of divine ascension. But <sup>9</sup>

أُفكِّرُ: وَحْدَهُ، كان النبيّ محمِّدٌ

I think: alone, the Prophet Muhammad

يتكلِّمُ العربيَّةَ الفُصْحَى. ((وماذا بعد؟))

spoke formal Arabic. “And what then?”

:ماذا بعد؟ صاحت فجأة جنديّةٌ

What then? A female soldier said suddenly

هُوَ أَنتَ ثانيةً؟ أَلم أَقتلْكَ؟

Is that you once again? Did I not kill you?

.قلت: قَتَلْتني... ونسيتُ، مثلك، أن أَموت


I said: You killed me… and I forgot, as did you, to die.

<sup>1</sup> أَسيرُ has a double meaning — it also means prisoner. So the line can also mean “A prisoner between eons without a memory”.

<sup>2</sup> تُصوِّبُني literally means “to aim” or “shoot”, like from the barrel of a gun.

<sup>3</sup> المقدَّس has the same root as Jerusalem, which is اَلْـقُـدْس which literally means “the holy”. This root shows up again two lines below (sacred). Mahmoud Darwish here is clearly associating this divine history, as well as the sacred love and peace (next line) with Jerusalem itself.

<sup>4</sup> his was a hard sentence to translate, even literally. By light’s word I believe Mahmoud Darwish is referring to God’s word. At the end, I think here he is employing two meanings: 1) he is saying that (religious) storytellers disagree on stories that are set in stone (set either by them or by God themself), 2) he is referring to the Foundation Stone (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_Stone) which is a stone in Jerusalem; Jewish and Muslim people have their own corresponding meaning/significance attached to it.

<sup>5</sup> ٍشحيحِ (translated as meager) is a hard word to translate. It means greedy, or like tight-fisted (maybe stubborn, in this context contested over).. it can even mean “mean” or meager, scarce. Fady Joudah translates it as “dimly lit”, which can make sense — it is insufficient, scarce, and it lacks light, yet it can so quickly “spark” into war.

<sup>6</sup> أخفُّ has the same root as “frighten” or “fear”.

<sup>7</sup> Technically this can say “The words sprout like grass…” but the verb comes first in this poem (which is grammatically sound in Arabic but not as much in English) so I decided to keep it for the ~ vibes ~.

<sup>8</sup> تَأْمَنُوا and تُؤْمنوا have the same root; the second word (تَأْمَنُوا) can mean to believe in or to secure something, or to be made safe.

<sup>9</sup> I used "I am not I" instead of "I am not myself" because the word أنا is written as a subject, not an object. The grammar is "odd" in the Arabic too, normally you would say "I am not myself" (i.e. myself =  نفسي), but I think Mahmoud Darwish uses "I" to intentionally say that he does not exist, there is no "I" in the presence of divine ascension. Furthermore, المعراج means ascension, but also specifically can refer to the Prophet Muhammad (S)’s night ascension/journey to heaven: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra_and_Mi%27raj.
