Ah, do you remember the time we walked from the movie theater to my house, when you told me you loved me? Did you notice the way my legs were shaking, and how my eyes were darting around, my voice shaking and vulnerable—though maybe it was the Minnesota cold, or the moon’s heavy stare—or maybe you didn’t notice those things at all, when you told me, when you touched my arm and I smiled at you?

I had never been with someone until then, and it is not like we made love that night, but you touched me—you touched me and it felt foreign, something on my skin I could not feel both sides of, a kiss on the cheek and a finger through my hands, delicately, sadly and with hope—I never want to be touched like that again.

I fell into you, as you had fallen into me, and your skin felt so soft when it touched mine—I was new, I built myself for you, the feeling is gone forever.

<br>
And when we got back to my house—my parents were asleep, we tiptoed upstairs, we whispered in the dark—I showed you my room, and I saw it like I hadn’t seen it before, I saw it through your eyes, I saw it in the dark, you showed me myself, all of myself in every place I hadn’t looked. You pranced around my room, asking what everything was, touching this and that and looking back at me, and I responded:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a painting my mom gave me for my birthday,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stuffed animal I won on a field trip,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a poster of my favorite post-rock band,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sketch I drew on a rainy Sunday evening,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you would prance and prance and I would follow you, then take you into my arms as I trembled, I trembled as I told you things I’d never tell anyone again.

<br>
We whispered through the night and I hid you in my bed, like you were my secret—you were my secret, my lovely—and my arm fell asleep under you, and I didn’t want to move it and wake you up—how naive were we, love? How naive were we to think such triviality wouldn’t lose its novelty, how naive were we to think that this excitement would last?

I wonder now, does anyone think what they have will last, or do we not consider what lies ahead at all? When I said I’d be with you forever, perhaps I was not speaking of the future, but of the present—this endless present, a present forever, one where you would stay in my arms and time would pass no longer, and the future would cease to exist and the earth would stop turning and we would stay still in each other’s arms, like the ruins of Pompeii, like a mother clutching her child in a fire, frozen in time—what use would we have of a future when we had ourselves?

I thought I could beat time, we thought we could fight God, but we lost, we lost we lost we lost, and we spiraled into nothingness; our love accepted reality when reality needed to accept our love, then we died the worst of deaths—an unbirth, a stillness neverending.

<br>
I still think of the first time we made love; I remember nothing but your hands, how I loved them on my neck, my body, my back—my God, above all else, how it felt for them to join with mine; it felt like our memories, my dreams and your spirit were flowing through our veins, into and out of each other’s hearts—I swear I heard your heart beat, lovely, I swear my heart beat with yours, together, in and out, ventricles and atria compressing and expanding, bleeding into each other’s souls; my heart was in my hands; had you felt it, love?

Maybe it was the way the rain knocked on our windows like it was watching, the way the thunder masked our screams; oh lovely, no one knew but us what was happening in that room, they could only dream of what we had—and then we threw it away, did we? Or did it leave us, the way my heart stopped beating with yours slowly, the way my hands fell into my pockets, the way I stood on my own rather than fall into you… I didn’t mean to. I didn’t mean to, I swear, but it happened—time aged us, and even when I fell to my knees, God turned his back onto my prayers.

<br>
The months passed, and the years passed too, and the rush I felt with you became harder to reach—the magic we felt every day visited me only once a week, then every month, and I held on like a child; it was my fix, I was searching for more, so I looked in our past, I looked to the future, I looked everywhere but the present, a rotting fruit teeming with worms and surrounded by flies. But the fruit was beautiful once, was it not? And the fruit may be beautiful again, could it?

As we got older, I had lost that patience, and I had seen all the parts of you, and maybe that is how love is, where the chase and the escalation are magical, but then you get to some plateau where you can see everything and nothing at the same time, some clearing where you can breathe freely but alone—I realize: I would not like to breathe freely but to breathe with my heart in my hands, to stutter and to question, then fall back into you, because I would kill for those moments of vulnerability again, I would kill us if we could start over, I would kill us to start over so things may go as they should.

<br>
And when we went back to the theater, I had felt something, some vision of us running and holding hands near the ticket booth, and I would walk around and look behind and it would disappear, and all that would be left was you, holding your tickets and smiling your plain and beautiful smile, as if to say, what are you looking at? or what did we do to deserve this? Who are we, Cathy? What have we become?

And that smile brought me to our summers, where we would drive past the woods and the highway, and we would sit on the roof of my car and love each other, and you’d look at me with tears in your eyes, make these noises I hoped no one could hear—how I miss that fear, my love, how I miss that sensation where my stomach was churning and sweat collected on my forehead, because now I feel nothing but love for you, and love with no gimmicks is love in its decline; I feel its decline, Cathy. I feel its decline.

And when we watched this movie, and I left for the restroom in the middle and could find you no longer, I remember feeling that you were gone forever, when my soul settled and I knew. I wanted to leave you in the theater to yourself, I wanted to go home and be alone, I wanted to disappear so that all we had could remain intact before it falls apart before our eyes; I know it will Cathy, and I know it will kill us with its slow, calculated cuts, its slow and confused tears and its smaller fights that grow bigger.

Cathy, I want to leave you in that theater, I want to leave us where we are—I see nothing from this clearing except the way forward, which is the way down, and I wouldn’t wish that on someone I love, the feeling of a love in its decline, agony of a slow and gradual death—can we just disappear? Can we perhaps not be born so we may not die now? Can we fall into thin air before we trip and falter over ourselves?

<br>
I look into your eyes, Cathy, and all I see is you. All I see are your soul and your tears, what you knew and what you once had, insecurities that shook me when you told me of them, but now you fit like a puzzle completed—I know you, Cathy.

I know you and I am finished.

I know you and I am lost.

I’ve gone surfing almost every other day ever since my mother died. Three or four mornings a week, I take the A to where the big rock jetties line the Rockaway, each of them separating the next beach one block away. I go in the early morning to see ten or twenty people lined up per jetty, and I wait in line until I feel the waves ringing in my ears and the water sloshing under my feet.

<br>
At least once every day in my childhood, my mother threw me up and down, like it was a ritual, some secret we shared in our own little world. Anytime I’d fuss, or feel hyper, or for no reason at all, she’d take me in her arms—holding me under my armpits, smiling at me while I looked from above—and throw me as high as she could.

When she was dying, I knew she wanted to throw me again, but instead—crippled on her hospital bed—she reminisced: “Arjun, on your way up, you looked so confused, no matter how many times we did it. I’m sure it felt like it was your first time, every time. But when you got to the top, terror. Your face was filled with terror, Arjun, I wish you could see it. Like you pooped your pants or you saw a ghost, you know. I’d feel so bad for you during those split seconds, but then you’d fall, you’d start falling—and bliss. All that was on your face was bliss. And it made it worth it, you know. For you and for me.”

I would ask her to do it again and again, and of course she would do it, at least until her arms tired or I got distracted—my dad coming home from work, the cat staring at us—and I asked again and again, again and again until I became too old to ask her, or she became too old to throw me. 

I don’t remember the last time she threw me, but I remember what it felt like. It felt, literally, like falling in love. This terror, this anxiety, all encapsulated within some being outside yourself, and the daring—the daring of mind and body to push through its impulses in the name of trust—and the landing, with the surprise and the affirmation—and the safety. The safety and the surrender, because no matter how scared I was, no matter how high I went, I always ended up in her arms. Because she looked me in the eyes as I fell. It was an act of love, to separate me and bring me back to her; it’s how I learned to love and how I learned to let go.

<br>
When I get on the waves, I feel her with me. I feel her under my board, guiding me gently—and when I fall, she picks me up. She comes back when I need her, like she wasn’t gone all along, and I surf with her, my ammi, I surf with her by my side.

I think of us, my dearest mother who left my life when I needed her the most—I’m only twenty-two, amma, I’m only twenty two and I barely know how to live, how to cook and how to love myself—how could I do any of this without you? Why didn’t you tell me before you passed?

Up and down, the water bounces my body. Up and down, the waves take me over. Up and down, my dearest Arjun; I shed my tears into the sea.

And the waves return to shore.

Soft. It was soft and it was small, what we had. It was insignificant; I don’t need to talk about it. It was just a thought; it’s all I had. But it was small, it was precious, and I wonder—would it have grown if we let it?

Why can’t I have you, lovely?

I know it wasn’t much; I had not much to offer, but there was a light in our souls—did you see it? When we walked close to each other, there was some tiny bit of friction, and that friction created a spark, and that spark created a candlelight—nothing more, I need not make it more than it is. But I wonder—if we blew on it gently, if we cupped our hands right, if we came together just once or just twice, would the fire have grown? Could it have given us more than we wanted?

Why can’t I have you, lovely?

I met you at the beach. It was cloudy, the rocks were cold, the waves felt distant as we sat there in our ennui. I won’t act like it was destiny. I won’t act like it was fate. But maybe, you know, under the grey sky, next to the freezing water, I may have seen our light, even just for a second. Maybe the setting brought us together. Maybe it was showing us something. We sat and talked as the sun set; the fire flickered, grew, became still. We talked until it was dark; we talked more. You left, we exchanged numbers. A month passed. I told you I loved you.

Why can’t I have you, lovely?

Why do we waste our time with such insignificant things? I can’t pretend it was anything more than that: a light that guided me home, only to turn off when I found it—oh, I don’t know. It seems like a waste. Why must we let go of things? What did you mean when you said you weren’t sure? I’ve never felt that way before. All it was was an afternoon. An afternoon, an evening, a night: a grey sky, an orange one, black, and one that shone bright, scorching white, blinding with the moon. Blinded by the moon.

Why can’t I have you, lovely?

You told me about your parents. I don’t remember their names. Your father remarried after your mother left him. You said you were happy for him—I saw a look on your face that conveyed a genuine love. It was just a look, nothing more, but I saw you love. I knew you knew what it was. You were in between jobs, you found an internship at Business Insider, and you were thinking: maybe it was your break, you know. It wasn’t the kind of writing you did, and the people weren’t what you imagined, but you had to start somewhere, right? I wonder what you made of it, Sarah. I wonder where you are.

Why can’t I have you, lovely?

We kissed that night, under the stars. By then, we were freezing, our hands found their ways to each other, you sat on my picnic blanket and draped yours over our legs. All we did was kiss. People kiss all the time; I can’t say it was special. But the kiss lit my fire that much more, and I saw us among the stars, you know. The little campfire we lit in our hearts, under that blanket, on that cold, dead, rocky beach—I saw it in the stars that night. I pointed to it but it was gone by the time you looked. I promise you, Sarah, it was there. By God, it was there, and sometimes I look at the sky and I see it once again.

Why can’t I have you?

It’s been two years and I still think of you. Two years—I don’t know why.

I remember your eyes when you told me.

I remember how they looked when we first fell in love.

eyes shut, or blinking slowly, lips curled like your toes were, yes your toes were on that rainy evening after the In-N-Out closed, and we had to run home because we didn’t want to wait for the bus—was it your home or mine?—was it your choice or mine?—yes I remember those toes, you had just put nail polish on them, it was green, or light pink with smileys on them, and I was never a foot man, I found them disgusting did I? but I kissed them and I made my way up your legs until I looked up and your eyes were melting from your skull, and your lips were laden with saliva, and I joined you in your thoughts, and you joined me in my heart, and I looked at those toes as they curled and I thought to myself, how deeply the ugly can love, how deeply I fell in love with you,

and you were not good enough for me, though I knew—did you have anything going for you but me? would your life have fallen apart if I left you?

but I did not leave you, you left me, you left me and I fell apart, my greatest self, thinking of the rain that evening—if it did not rain would we have ran? would we have made love? would we have been together now?

I loved you as I knew I was better. I knew I could do better, I knew it and I know it now as I sit in this—shack?—where am I? sitting, sitting and thinking of you and the hole you left in my ceiling and the boots you left on my shoe rack, thinking of how I could have done better, I could do better and I will do better, you with your ugly toes, your unsymmetrical face, you with your stupid eyes and that lovely dress you wore that I could have torn if it did not come apart so easily, the one with flowers over such grassy green—viridis? is that the word—

maybe you left the dress in my closet, maybe I can get up from where I’ve been and find it, maybe it is upstairs, waiting for me, I will

I will go and I will see it, I will go and I will see it and it will be waiting for me, I will embrace it and it will accommodate my body as it did, yes it will wrap around me as it whispers in my ear, “my love, you have grown so somber, my love, I cannot live without you,”

and I will believe it, I will believe it because you are so ugly, your fucking laugh and your personality and—how many friends did you keep while we were together?—did you even have any hobbies?—fucking ugly, and I know you cannot live without me, so I wait in this basement, but it feels like an attic, because I know you will fall through the hole in my ceiling and your body will summon mine, and I will call the spirits, and they will watch us make love, watch us fuck one last time before you float through the ceiling again, leaving me to rot in this hellhole you created for me:

and maybe, we would still have ran

In one day I had lost such integral, special things.

- My father: the softest voice I've heard in a man, the way he’d watch over me on our hikes and at the supermarket—the quietness I felt with him, silence I haven’t felt alone.
- My mother: the gracious look she gave me when I’d come home in time for dinner, chicken casserole that filled my sinuses, stomach, heart—I still don’t know how food can taste so much like love.
- My sister: her perfume that eased me when I sat next to her, her hugs that made me feel like a boy, her laugh that crawled into my ears and lit up my cortex—it’s dark now, silent and brooding.
- My legs: the feeling of crossing and shaking them, my runs which cleared my head and made me feel human; above all, the sensation of blood flowing in and out of it—something I cannot describe that I will never feel again.

<br>
I killed them. I killed them all, my legs too. I drove them home from a road trip to the mountains, it was almost midnight, they were all asleep—I fell asleep too, my eyes rolling into my head and a warm blanket gracing my face—I crossed the street. My father died on impact. My sister died in the ambulance. My mother died in the hospital the next day. I became paralyzed from the waist down.

I wish I hadn't looked at their bodies as they rolled us out. Disfigured, agape, inhuman. They looked like demons, and they come to me in my dreams. I did that to them. I did that and they never changed back. They never came back.

<br>
On the day of the funeral, I saw something leave their caskets. It was not a smell, it was not a sound either. Something emanated, then left to the sky and I knew I couldn’t join it. I asked, I asked and begged, but it pushed me back—pungent, it was pungent, shouting—and a tree reached over me, I retreated into the shade.

I saw them before they were banished underground, when their caskets raised—standing—and they faced me. I knew they were staring. I knew what they were thinking in the way they stood; the shade fell away, and I stood to answer for my crimes.

By God, when their bodies opened up from the caskets, and I saw for a moment—time standing still—their bodies in their majesty, I could see and smell nothing but the vestiges of their lives. My father’s face was blown open, my sister’s neck twisted with her skin peeling off, my mother’s arm dangling from its cavity—their bodies opening, God, their bodies were open and I saw into their souls. I couldn’t look away—I’d be damned—but their faces melted off their skeletons, their limbs motioned to me, they were calling—was I to join them? Oh, the way they opened; sweet mercy and submission; I walked to their embrace: dad, I love you, I love you and I’m sorry I never opened up; mom, I miss you and wish you could hear me; sis, I look up to you and must come into your arms; the caskets closed. They eased into the earth. I was alone. I was sealed shut. The shade fell over me. I returned to my broken body.
