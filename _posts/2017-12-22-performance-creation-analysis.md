This blog post may sound very abstract and confusing, but it is the definition of an idea that may help me (and people with similar tendencies as I) decide what to do in life, how to do it, and what kind of themes or objects to work with. Please note that this concept is extremely subjective to how *I* do things, and assumes a few things (which I will present at the end). Also, I didn't really proofread this post, but I'm just putting it out there in case it clicks for someone else.

In layman's terms, I have had trouble understanding what I actually want to do in life. For example, I am unsure whether I want to be an artist (in e.g. video game development) or an academic (in e.g. economics). This is compounded with my confusion on if I like something or not. For example, I'd really like video game development theory and analyzing how video games are made, yet I wouldn't like creating a video game myself. I would think, is the problem that I am just bad at creating games? Or do I just dislike games? I thought about this consistent problem and came across an epiphany.

The crux of this concept is that you can interact with an object in three ways. There is performance, creation, and analysis. You can either perform an object using a skill, create an object using a medium, or analyze an object using a framework.

In doing each of these methods comes a prerequisite and an axis of perfection.

**In performance**, the object must be thought out and excellent. The axis of perfection is the manifestation. This means that when performing something, you must like the thing you are performing. The challenge is to know how to put it into reality (manifestation) well, doing justice to the object. For example, if I am a comedian, I must have my pieces thought out (by me or someone else) and I must like them inherently -- Like the actual piece, not necessarily its performance --. The challenge, then, is performing this piece well, so that I can fully embody my skit and put it into being. It's kind of like the flute in Futurama, you have to make as sharp and realistic an image as possible when playing this flute.

**In creation**, the object must exist in some form before its creation in the medium. The axis of perfection is the translation. This means that creating something must come from a source. It could be abstract: like a feeling or an idea, or defined: like an event or an image. Either way, the axis of perfection is in converting (translating) this object into a given medium.

Note when I say we create an object, I am framing this as creating something *based* on an original object. My definition of creation is putting this abstract object into an implemented medium. For example, when I write poetry, I often create a poem out of an original feeling I have of anxiety or awe. Here, I have to convert this feeling into a poem of words.

**In analysis**, the object must not be completely defined or understood, and (some of) its components must also be unknown. The axis of perfection is the definition. This means that I have an object I want to analyze, and I have to break it down. However, I don't completely understand the object, and I don't entirely know how to break it down. For example, I can be analyzing the behavior of humans under stress. Here, I have to break down this phenomenon of acting under stress and examine how and why people act the way they do. This works because the object (how humans act under stress) is not completely known, and also its makeup (what factors or components determine how a human acts under stress) is unknown as well. I have to further define this phenomenon by either introducing a new component or factor, or by modeling how components or factors interact in making this phenomenon (or both). So, I can find a new function in the brain that influences how humans act under stress, or I can analyze how known functions interact (like what priority they are presented in). Or I can do both and add a new function and add it into an overall model of how humans act under stress.

Note that this structure is somewhat recursive, in that the performance, creation, or analysis of an object is an object itself. For example, teaching is performance of an analysis. I would analyze an object, and "perform" that analysis (the analysis is being the object this time). Spoken word is performance of a creation. I could create a piece from an object (like a feeling), then perform that poem as the object. Any field or action can have any amount of recursive layers included. So, I see game development as only creation of an idea, and nothing else. Other things can be a performance of an analysis of a creation, and so on.

Now, obviously, analyzing something through a framework of psychology is very different than analyzing its ethical implications. So, there must be an acknowledgment of the skills, mediums, and frameworks used with these methods. How does one flourish in a certain medium, while enjoying it as well?

To enjoy success in **performing** using a certain skill, you must enjoy the application of objects through this skill, especially in the form of practice. Remember, the axis of perfection is manifestation. For example, playing songs on the drumset is much easier for me than the piano. I feel more comfortable applying music with drums, and I like practicing more as well. This means I prefer honing a skill in drumming than in playing piano.

With **creating** using a certain medium, you must enjoy the medium's innovation process of an object, i.e. the process of translating the object into the medium (since creation's axis of perfection is translation). For me, this means when I want to explore an idea, writing comes much easier than drawing for that. Hence, my preferred medium of creation is writing.

And when **analyzing** using a certain framework, you must enjoy breaking down an object using that framework, and especially the increased understanding of the object that comes with it. The axis of perfection for analysis is definition. So, this can mean me liking economic analysis of phenomena rather than a technological one, because I'm better at defining societal implications. That said, I personally like analyzing through many different frameworks. It's my preference to be an analytical jack of all trades but it also makes it hard for me to commit to one field of analysis to specialize in.

In closing, the goal of this post was to help me unpack what I actually like. Hopefully, with this framework, I (and maybe others) can understand what kind of projects I would like, in relation to the object being centered, as well as the method being used. Ideally, this can morph into a general understanding of what kind of career I want, how it will use these 3 methods (performing, creating, analyzing), what specific medium(s) I'd utilize, and what topics (or objects) I am best at working with.

As an addendum, here are a couple assumptions I made with this framework.

* Assumption 1: This framework puts the object first. This is biased because many people are not object oriented. For example, a master drummer may care about the medium (drumming) more than the objects they are performing (the piece, song, or genre). They can perform anything and enjoy it as long as it is drumming. I simply don't work this way. I need objects to center my actions around.

* Assumption 2: This framework is more about wanting to do something than being able to do it. For example, I can definitely analyze something that's thoroughly defined. This can be like splitting up an essay into its introduction, body, and conclusion. However, I definitely wouldn't enjoy this, as both the object and its deconstructed components are defined. Here, the objective is getting the answer right rather than understanding the object (this would be the actual nature of the essay) better.

* Assumption 3: Practicality is not a factor. This framework is for understanding how to succeed internally in how you interact with the world. This internal success is not necessarily tied to external success, a level of influence, or recognition. Basically, you can completely love what you do, and interact with your themes and objects very healthily, but still be bad. Or, you can be very good, but other people don't completely understand or digest it the same way you would. I could be an excellent musician, and create songs that perfectly translate feeling or theme into music, but the method in which I translate this may not be accessible or understandable to most. Art, and really any innovative interaction with the world, is tragic.
