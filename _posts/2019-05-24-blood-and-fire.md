blood and fire

to come anew

blood, sixteen

fire twenty two

<br>
i leave myself

as im left behind

blood and fire

reborn in time

<br>
to start again

a leap of faith

blood and fire

growing pains

<br>
a different self

i must come undone

blood and fire

old songs unsung

<br>
to be again

i must be no more

death and light

for love and war

<br>
erase the past

in all but mind

blood and fire

another life

<br>
i built this all

it was all for you

was it meant to fall?

or did we choose?

<br>
blood and fire

reborn, renewed

death and light

reforming truth

<br>
river styx

make me strong

god almighty

bring the dawn

<br>
i dream sometimes

tomorrow, yesterday

but today i bleed

and in today i stay

<br>
i burn alive

from ash i rise

blood and fire

i am alive
