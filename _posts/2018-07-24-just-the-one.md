It's only been 9 years. 9 years since I ruined three lives in the matter of a few seconds. I still can’t own up to the responsibility. Sometimes, I wish I could forget, but I can’t. I don’t want to. I need them in my life, even in the form of drifting memories.

"--you know how it is. My wife didn't think it was a good idea, but I really thought it would have been good for the kids."

I zone back into reality. As I look around this old Subway car, I wonder why this man is still talking to me. He’s wearing a blue hawaiian shirt with white flowers on it, along with generic blue jeans. I see that he, too, must default to the boring, unobtrusive nature of the color. The subway car bleeds more of an ugly yellow than normal, and there’s more graffiti than I remember, but the colors actually go well together. Either way, the city must be short on funds.

"Well anyway, I could tell you were a dad too when I saw you talk to that lost little girl."

The girl. He approached me after I helped a girl find her mother. Now, he's talking to me about kids and parenting.

"It's just something all parents share, you know?"

"Once you go through it, you're never the same," I responded.

"Exactly. Just the other day, I --"

I zone out again. Almost immediately, I’m at the scene again. It was 2009, and we were coming back from my mother-in-law’s on Thanksgiving. The 2 hour drive down I-95 at night was my idea, even though I knew I was tired. The insurance company believes that the crash was the other car’s fault, but I know I could have avoided it. When the car swerved left to our lane, I was zoned out. It took me a half second to register what was going on, and by then, it was too late. The car was a bright red convertible in my headlights, how could I not have noticed? Why didn’t I tell my daughter to put her seatbelt on? Why didn’t I let my wife drive?

I remember, so vividly, watching my daughter being carried from my totaled car towards the ambulance, praying for a medical miracle. Seeing my little girl, so young, unconscious on a stretcher, red and blue sirens dancing on her face with the moonlight.. I'll never forget it. I'll never forget the way my tears stretched the colors on the scene, bleeding them to infinity. Never in my life will I forget that sight.

Back then, she had just started 3rd grade. She loved school, because her homeroom teacher had an interest in art and illustration. He would let her stay in the classroom during lunch break so she could play around with his watercolors and colored pencils. By God, she was so talented, though all she would draw were trees, grass, and clouds. In heaven, I pray she can draw as many clouds as she wants to. I hope, while she paints, her colors fall from up above, seeping down to this earth.

"--but now, we've finally started to reconcile our parenting styles. You ever think you can reach that point? Where you and your wife just stop the bickering and become a unit?"

Back again. I need to say something.

"Sometimes, you just can't fix it. Having a kid changes you," I add, obviously distracted. I don't think he's noticed yet.

"Yeah, you might be right. But you at least have to try to--"

I've always believed that eye contact is the most direct way to show trust and affection. I used to measure how intimate a relationship was from how much eye contact we made. After my wife recovered from her neck injury, she refused to make eye contact. Our daughter had my eyes, and she couldn't look me in my eyes without breaking down. We tried to love without it, but love without trust, love without affection.. It’s nothing more than an honored commitment. We knew it was lost. Our love died by the next year, and we divorced the day after the 4th of July. I still miss her, and I still wish she never had to leave.

We've lived alone since then. We're too old to have kids, and our only one is gone. I can't help but wonder how different life would be if our daughter survived that crash. I’ve managed to moved on, as much as one could from death. I'm old, almost 60, but I have a job, and my own humble apartment. But I don't think I’ll be happy again, not without my family.. Sometimes, though, I start to feel like she’s with me now, accompanying me on my trips to nowhere. Those fleeting moments, where I forget that she’s gone, and I forget I'm alone.. they're the only thing keeping me alive. After all, I'm still her dad. I have to be. I can't be anything else.

"--an exhausting responsibility. My wife wants to get a carpool, but I refuse.”

The train creaks as it approaches my stop. I reach for my backpack, while hawaiian blue keeps talking.

“It’s because every day, when I pick them up from school, that’s when I’m reminded it's all worth it. All for my two angels. How many kids you got?"

"Just the one," I say, as I get up, avoiding eye contact. I turn to walk to the Subway doors.

"How old is she now?"

"17. She's 17."
