It's only been 9 years. 9 years since I ruined three lives in the matter of a few seconds. I still can’t own up to the responsibility. Sometimes, I wish I could forget, but I can’t. I don’t want to. I need them in my life, even in the form of drifting memories.

"--you know how it is. My wife didn't think it was a good idea, but I really thought it would have been good for the kids."

I zone back into reality. As I look around this old Subway car, I wonder why this man is still talking to me. He’s wearing a blue hawaiian shirt with white flowers on it. His jeans are blue too. I see that he, too, must default to the boring, unobtrusive nature of the color. The subway car bleeds more of an ugly yellow than normal, and there’s more graffiti than I remember, but the colors actually go well together. Either way, the city must be short on funds.

"Well anyway, I could tell you were a dad too when I saw you talk to that lost little girl."

The girl. He approached me after I helped a girl find her mother. Now, he's talking to me about kids and parenting.

"It's just something all parents share, you know?"

"I know. Once you go through it, you're never the same," I responded.

"Exactly. Just the other day, I --"

I zone out again. Almost immediately, I'm at the scene again. It was 2009. We were coming back from my mother-in-law’s on Thanksgiving, since I lobbied to make that 2 hour drive down I-95 at night. I remember, so vividly, watching her being carried from my totaled car towards the ambulance, praying for a medical miracle. Seeing my little girl, so young, completely unconscious on a stretcher, red and blue sirens dancing on her face with the moonlight.. I'll never forget it. I'll never forget the way that my tears stretched the colors on the scene, bleeding them to infinity. Never in my life will I forget that sight.

Back then, she had just started 3rd grade. She loved school, because her homeroom teacher also loved to draw. He would let her stay in the classroom during lunch break and play around with his watercolors and colored pencils. By God, she was so talented, but all she would draw were trees, grass, and clouds. I hope she could draw as many clouds as she wants in heaven. I hope, while she draws, her colors fall from heaven down to this earth.

"--but now, we've finally started to reconcile our parenting styles. You ever think you can reach that point? Where you and your wife just stop the bickering and become a unit?"

Back again. I need to say something.

"Sometimes, you just can't fix it. Having a kid changes you."

"Yeah, you might be right. But you at least have to try to--"

My wife. I miss her, and I wish she never left. But, after the accident, even after she recovered from her neck injury, she still couldn't look me in the eyes. Our daughter had my eyes, and it drove her to tears seeing them in me. I always believed that eye contact is the most direct way to show trust and affection, and I would measure how intimate a relationship was from how much eye contact we made. But, this time, we tried to love without it. Love without trust, without affection.. It’s nothing more than an honored commitment. We knew it was lost. Our love died by the next year, and we divorced the day after the 4th of July.

Now, we both live alone. Both in our 50s, too old to have kids, our only one gone. I can't help but wonder how different life would be if our daughter survived that crash. I’ve managed to moved on, as much as one could from death. I have a job, my own place, even bought a motorbike a month ago. But I don't think I’ll be happy again. Not without my family. But sometimes, I start to feel like she’s with me now, accompanying me on my trips to nowhere. Those fleeting moments, where I forget that she’s gone, and I forget I'm alone.. they're the only thing keeping me alive. After all, I'm still her dad. I have to be. I can't be anything else.

"--an exhausting responsibility. My wife wants to get a carpool, but I refuse.”

The train creaks as it approaches my stop. I reach for my backpack, while hawaiian blue keeps talking.

“It’s because every day, when I pick them up from school, that’s when I’m reminded it's all worth it. Anything for my two angels. How many kids you got?"

"Just the one," I say, as I get up, avoiding eye contact. I turn to walk to the Subway doors.

"How old is she now?"

"17. She's 17."
