Death and mortality have been on my mind lately.

I recently talked to my grandmother who I visited this New Years (in California). She mentioned that she was happy I came back in January, because if she dies soon, she'd have been able to see me one last time before then. My grandmother is a few weeks from 89 and her health has been declining lately. She helped raise me and I love her a lot, though I admit shamefully that I don't call her as much as I should. What makes things scarier is that I've never experienced the death of anyone close to me, ever. In the 22 years of my life, not an uncle, aunt, cousin, grandparent, friend, sibling, or parent. I've been to funerals of extended family, or family friends, people I've met maybe once or twice in my life, but that's it. I don't know how it feels. What is death like?

I've also noticed recently that suicide has become more talked about the last few years than it ever was. Famous celebrities and artists lost themselves to suicide and drug abuse, which sent ripples across the world, sparking conversations about mental health (conversations non-celebrities have been trying to have for years). I myself have had an extremely difficult year, and though I've gotten better at dealing with turmoil, I still think about death constantly when life is overwhelming. My mental health can be precarious at times.

But what does it mean to think about killing yourself in a time where people are mass slaughtered in their schools and places of worship? What does it mean to grieve for lives lost when we are doing so little to fix the causes of these tragedies? What does it mean to be scared of dying when we aren't even leading lives we value in the first place?

I've noticed that Americans in particular have an odd relationship with death. The concept of death is always followed by some form of pathos. Bringing it up in a conversation makes the air feel heavier. Motivational speakers use it to spark a feeling of urgency and determination in people. It's both feared and avoided, somehow. On everyone's minds but not entirely addressed or understood. Death is something we can think about later. And yet when tragedies surface, we grieve deeply in the moment and then forget about it after a week. Paradoxical, no?

It seems to me that people are either entirely afraid of death or they find themselves longing for it. Yet death does not care. Death is agnostic, it is neutral. It exists. It is a reality. It does not serve a particular purpose or design. From dust we come from and to dust we will return.

I mean, advances in medicine, technology, and aid increase our life expectancy each year. Bill Gates himself uses decreasing infant mortality rates and increasing life expectancy as arguments for the world getting better. Yet what does this mean if our daily lives don't change? If we are less happy, more insecure, just as depressed? If millions of us are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling every day just to survive? If we have to deal with microaggressions, trauma, and health complications every single day?

Humans have been trying to understand life and death for thousands of years. As someone who loves philosophy, I'll spare you the details. But it seems we still don't have it figured out. Or rather, maybe life and death is not something to be "figured out" in the first place.

The truth of the matter is that where we come from and where we go is something we'll never completely understand. Yet regardless, it is something we must confront. That's where the confusion comes from. We don't know how to react to death.

But we try. I mean, we try very hard. Humans mourn. We continue to love deeply despite the loss it may bring. We strive to live fulfilling lives despite its temporality. We aim to improve our broken world even as we are bound to leave it eventually.

And the hardest thing to do in the face of death is to accept it. Especially when they happen due to the most unjust of circumstances, due to terrorism, abuse, physical and financial inequity. But to accept death is not to resign ourselves to it. Accepting death does not mean devaluing life.

In fact, it is becoming apparent to me that it is necessary to have a healthy relationship with death in order to lead a fulfilling life—to lead lives worth dying for. Not lives that make us want to die, nor lives that make us want to avoid death, but lives that help us accept it as an unavoidable reality. Lives that, when the time comes, anticipated or not, we can look back on with contentedness. Lives we can be ready to leave at any time, but that we value deeply as we experience them.

And not just our individual lives. We should aim to give everyone the life, as well as the death, that they deserve. A life of dignity, a death of dignity. A life with a constant presence of love, a death with one too.

No one deserves to be killed in their homes and safe spaces, be it where they live, their school, their place of worship, or their community center. Consequently, no one deserves to live in fear of these places being unsafe.

No one deserves to die in self-pity, loneliness, and depression. Consequently, no one deserves to face life completely alone, with no loved ones to understand them or give them a helping hand. No one deserves to have to deal with their hardships by themselves, to go through trauma, bullying, and abuse without knowing how to process it in a healthy way.

We should be just as outraged about unjust living conditions as we are unjust dying conditions. Let's be upset when an orphan starves to death, when a school or mosque is shot up, when someone is brought to commit suicide. But we should be just as impassioned as when an administration separates a child from their parents, when an economy leaves its people in poverty, when minorities are scared to step into their community center or drive their car, when a child is left to experience abuse and bullying alone, unable to process their trauma even well into their adult life. These unjust living conditions directly feed into these headlined tragedies.

I'm saying: **Let's not just mourn people's deaths, let's give them dignified and fulfilling lives to live.**

We can all do better. We can work towards a world where people have lives worth living, lives worth dying for, deaths worth living for. This manifests in the small things, like supporting your loved ones, checking in with people you haven't seen in a while, giving strangers a smile and a word of support, even in passing. It also manifests in the larger, structural things, in working towards a truly livable future. This means helping provide people consistent health care and sustenance so they don't have to worry about being one accident away from poverty. It means supporting policies that protect families and communities together without causing animosity in difference. And most importantly, it means resisting hate, oppression, and xenophobia worldwide and fighting institutions and administrations which perpetuate them.

In this day and age, death is tragic. It is uncertain, lonely, and unjust. Because of this, life is tragic as well. We deserve better. All of us do.

Death will visit all of us in time. Let's cultivate meaningful and fulfilling lives, illuminating our worlds as well as others'. Let's leave behind legacies that we, and everyone else, can look back on with gratification. Let us all live, love, heal, and die. And let us be proactive, not reactive in doing so.

With love,

Aamir
