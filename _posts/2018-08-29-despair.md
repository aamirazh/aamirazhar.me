Heavy rain, every day. [6]

This place stands littered with grey. [7]

Will light come back? I cannot say. [8]

But I know I've forgotten the day. [9]

<br>
With no light, I've lost my way. [7]

I must find hope, I search and pray. [8]

Instead I find, as I fall astray, [9]

This is all I know, darkness and despair. [10]
