i adore you, don't you hurt me

now and then / again

. . . . . . . .

the bleeding heart, it falls in orbit

to you and them / again

. . . . . . . .

and when im morbid, i know i don't deserve it

but here i go / again

. . . . . . . .

searching and found it, then i'm mourning

heaven and back / again

. . . . . . . .

will i find it, will i enjoy it

my body sets / again

. . . . . . . .

and when the claws itch, when i'm accosted

i fold and fold / again

. . . . . . . .

i see you in my dreams but, i forgot your skin's touch

my holy death / again

. . . . . . . .

so don't forget me, i know my tongue is deadly

the softest touch / it ends

. . . . . . . .

i'll find it, or i will leave here

for hazy wonderlands

. . . . . . . .

yeah i'm searching, until i can't go no further

im in over my head

. . . . . . . .

and no, i have no purpose, until im birthed

into love's tremendous arms

. . . . . . . .

it's time to look towards it, to lay this world to

its determined end

. . . . . . . .
