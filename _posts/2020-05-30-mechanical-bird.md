Touch me and make me whole. Remind me of my body; this world is physical but I forget. Everything I’ve touched I have wanted to touch.

This morning, I drank hot tea. For lunch, I touched the stove. Before dinner, I caressed my thighs. At night, I fingered my blankets.

No. Don’t tell me what I want. Show me.

When was the last time I wrote a love letter to a friend? A love letter, or just a message. A something something, a lovely love thing, a special nothing. I can’t draw hearts. Mine always get too fat and squishy. I’ll draw a star instead.

Love me. Replace the gaps in my life and then I’ll forget you when they’re filled. Be my best friend for a week and I’ll tell you I love you and you’re great.

Help me with my family. I can’t choose them. I love my mom, but I do nothing for her.

I guess, sometimes, I forget. I forget about everyone and only see myself, or one person. I’m ashamed at that. I don’t deserve them. Fix me like I’m broken and I’ll fly away. I’m your little mechanical bird — have you ever wanted one? I crush under your weight and need a cautious hand to keep me intact.

I’m your little mechanical bird. At least you’ll get to tinker with me before I leave.

Mechanical bird. Or I’ll fall and I’ll need you again.

Mechanical bird. Or I’ll force myself to keep going.

Mechanical bird. I want to be like the other ones.

A bird that can fly without falling down. I want to be soft to the touch and I want to let my feathers go without hurting so much. I want to be alone.

Own me. Dress me up and fix me. Then, I’ll fly away.
