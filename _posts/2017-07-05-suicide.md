**S**erenity: in dreaming of an escape.

**U**nderstanding: of the world as the monstrosity it is.

**I**nsufficiency: of stars of hope to latch on to.

**C**onfusion: about who you are and why you were born.

**I**llustration: of an alternate personality that is exhausting to perform as.

**D**estruction: of your past self, slowly.

**E**nding: of a life that was never yours to begin with.
