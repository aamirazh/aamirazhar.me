There was something in the way you looked at me, some contentment, a foreverness, a sea of love beneath your eyes; I couldn’t believe such tenderness could hurt me so. But maybe I should have known, every time you looked at me and I would die and come back to life—I should have known you would hurt me; it hurt every time.

You loved me, didn’t you? After I lost you, I told myself you didn’t—I told myself we never did. But then I remember that look, and it returns—our youth, our naivety, our utter helplessness towards ourselves—what our hearts were capable of—and each other. Yes, you loved me, and I loved you. I know, in the truest sense of the word, it is true. We put our hearts on the table and devoured them with our thirst. It was whole and it was genuine. Until it fell apart.

I wonder now, when you started to come back late, when you stopped responding to my texts in the middle of the day, was there someone else? You would come and talk of other people, and that look would return—desire, admiration, and I would be confused; did you mean them for me? That smile—teary eyes and trembling fingers—left my presence, and were you giving them to someone else? Do you still wear it on your face?

The look remained until the end. And every time you gave it, I would be helpless. You gave it until you left. You gave it as you broke my heart. Does that mean you still loved me then? And if we passed on the street, and you gave me that look once more—does that mean you still love me now? If you did, you would. I know it with my heart. I know it with my eyes.

I still long for its hypnosis. Take my heart. Eat it with your fork and knife. Melt it with your eyes. It is yours and I will answer your call. I will answer your eyes, I will bleed in front of you, I will die, and I will die in bliss. Open your eyelids slowly and I will follow. I will find it and give you what’s left of me, as I did before, as I would again.
