This book is the only children's book that has come back to me, time and time again, in my life, with different meanings and associations.

I read this book so many times as a kid. I think my mother liked it as well — sometimes I wonder how much of reading it with me was didactic, and how much of it was just reading something we enjoyed. In retrospect, the book had such an explicit foreshadowing for my life and upbringing that I was entirely oblivious to well into my early late teens and early 20s.

Despite the book's simplicity, it's hard to capture its essence and what it means to me in one review. I could write pages upon pages on it, the ideas it presents, and what it means to me. All I can say in this small little box is that it means a lot to me, and I still don't entirely understand its message and how it relates to my life. In my relationships and upbringing, I was always a Giving Tree, and in a way, I'm sure I read this book countless times being entirely okay with what the tree went through, and what she put herself through. Part of me still is. Part of me isn't anymore. The meaning of the book, and how I take its message changes every few years. I am still contemplating the nature of giving—what its significance is, what it requires, and who or what it should be done for—and I feel I will be for the rest of my life.

I look forward to returning to this book in a year or two and seeing how I may interpret its narrative differently. The book is just subtle, soft, nuanced enough to give me room to do that, while being distinct and profound enough to keep me coming back to it, time and time again. An incredible book. One that has become inseparable from my life, its essence, and its questions. Possibly my favorite book of all time, along with the entirely dissimilar graphic novel Watchmen.
