Home is an enigma. It is simultaneously within our control and without, in such a way that we cannot choose where we are born but we may choose where our children are.

As we move around our cities, countries, and continents, we find that people and places have gravity. These gravities intersect and create winds and hurricanes of family, employment, relationships, lifestyle, and education. They pull and push us, as they pulled and pushed those before us, to move, and keep moving.

There is a certain strength in calling a place home. It is a statement of intent. You may not be living there — many call faraway lands or places they cannot visit home. But in calling something home, you proclaim that it holds a place in your heart, and that it will continue to do so. You establish it as a body of gravity in your life, something that pulls you, however strong, to it. Home is a body; it has a presence; it demands to be considered, esteemed, and loved. In this sense, the word home carries with it a sense of romance, that even if you are not together, you loved it once, and you long for it at times. That even as you are apart, you think of it fondly sometimes, you hope it is doing well, and sometimes you entertain the idea that if your paths cross, that love may be rekindled again. Love is gravity, gravity is love, and home equips both in its disposition.

So when Inzamam, or Indy, as his college friends called him, went to see his family the summer after graduation, he thought not of it as going home. He told himself it was a visit, a trip, maybe even a vacation — but no, it was not a homecoming.

And when he stepped off the plane at LaGuardia Airport, he didn’t feel relieved. He felt anxious and upset at his girlfriend for convincing him to go. He hadn’t talked to his family for years, and though he knew his streak would have to end eventually, he didn’t want it to happen then.

For this was his summer, the summer after graduation when he’d become an adult. What could be more destructive to this process of self-actualization than visiting his parents, a pair of people who saw him as a being to be nurtured and cared for? He felt no autonomy at home, and he knew he wouldn’t feel it now, no matter how much older he thought he was.

*LaGuardia is a mess of an airport*, he thought to himself. The moment he walked past the jet bridge into the terminal, the chaos, sonder, and clamor of New York City came flooding into his mind and heart. People were talking loudly, yet they were also quiet and self-absorbed; they were looking straight at him and faintly into the distance at the same time. Though Indy would never admit it, he held a kind of nostalgia for New York, the kind of nostalgia anyone would acquire from their formative years, even if he recalled much less about high school than he did college or even his childhood.

And though he would never talk about New York glowingly the way other New Yorkers did, or talk about it with malice like they did too, he believed in his heart of hearts that it was the ideal place to come of age, simply because it pushes you. It packages such overwhelming options and noise in its exterior such that the only way to sort it out is to look to your interior. You can’t handle anything, until you can, and by then you know yourself.

New York was where a fresh and immaculate immigrant learned to breathe, both in providing his body with air as well as letting it go. He took this breath and its elasticity into his college years, content with and intent on staying in the company of his own thoughts and affections — his, and his alone.

Though he had since distanced himself from his father, he heard his voice in his head: *What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger!* In this respect, Indy agreed, and when he wasn’t avoiding the subject, he fantasized about raising his kids in the city. *Maybe in Sunset Park*, he thought, *whatever is furthest away from Jackson Heights.*

As he walked down the stale, slate walkway to the baggage claim, his phone throbbed in his pants pocket. He slowed with a mild annoyance matched by those who had to walk around him, then transferred his beige tote bag and carry-on to his left arm and took out his phone.

“Baaaaaaaabe!”

“What is it, Sam?”

“You told me you’d call me when you landed! It’s already 10 there and I was getting concerned!”

Indy stuck the phone between his shoulder and right ear and rubbed his right eye, still drowsy from his nap on the flight.

“Yeah, well, I’m a bit busy here,” he said.

“Your flight go okay? I miss you!” Sam made a smooching noise that reminded him of the kissing and smiling heart face emojis that she put at the end of her texts to him.

“It was fine. Just long, and the whole day is gone.”

“You sound tired, babe. But how does it feel to be home?”

Suddenly, thousands of miles away, Indy could see her curious face asking him this question, and he realized he missed her. When she asked questions, her accented eyebrows would raise, relax, and give way to her bulbous brown eyes. She had sharp features — a thin but sharp nose, an almost right-angled jawline — but when she talked to people, she would even those features somehow, and others would ease around her. Sam had a way about her, where she would act and look so innocent you couldn’t help but lean into the conversation. Not out of pity, but because you wanted to satisfy her, to see her tentative expression turn into realization, fulfillment, and even ecstasy in completing the picture she was constructing in her head.

But at heart, Indy knew Sam was strong and sovereign because when she slept, her complexion returned to a hardness she’d never let emit in the day. She looked abnormally serious in sleep, and when you caught her dreaming, she’d almost look disturbed. He wondered if she knew, if she held that understanding of herself, or if it was something only he and her mother had witnessed.

“This isn’t my home. You know how I feel about this.” Indy stepped on the escalator leading down to the baggage claim.

“Do I? You never talk to me, Indy. How am I supposed to know these things? Where else would your home be?”

“If I had to choose one, it would be Palo Alto.”

“What? Palo Alto is so boring, babe. You can’t choose Pakistan or New York? You’ve lived longer in those places than you did in Palo Alto.”

Indy didn’t want to have this discussion now. “Listen, can I call you back? I just got to the baggage claim and I need to get on the bus first.”

“Of course, love. But I expect an answer when you’re back. I love you.”

Sam was cheerful and excited. She sat on her couch in her white-themed bedroom in her family’s white ranch-style home in Palo Alto, waiting in anticipation for his call. Her couch was brown, but her walls and other furniture — desk, coffee table, bookshelf, drawers, and bedsheets — were white, the “I got this new from Ikea” kind of white that she loved. The wall across her couch was littered with pictures of them together, one batch arranged in an S shape and the other in an I. *It’s been almost two years*, she thought to herself, *and I’m still in love with him.* She truly loved Indy, and what she loved even more was learning about him. The highlight of her day was talking to him, and she called spontaneously twice a day (any more than that and he’d start to get annoyed).

For Sam, that’s what love was — attention, acceptance, and affection. She could never describe the way she felt, or tell you the difference between love and attraction, but she used the word freely from early on in their relationship. She did because every time she said “I love you”, it comforted her. It convinced her that this was something special, that it was real, and that she wanted him. It felt good to want someone else, and even though Indy didn’t say it back half the time (especially at first), she didn’t mind. The act of saying it was affirmation enough, and she trusted that he loved and cared for her in his own endearing and elusive way.

Indy sighed as he waited for his bag to appear on the conveyor belt. As he hand-combed his long, curly hair, he looked down at his black jeans and his white and light blue Nike Reacts. He didn’t care much for fashion, but he still liked looking at his shoes from time to time. He only wore jeans with solid colored polos or crew necks — today, it was a grey Ralph Lauren — but he was never insecure about being unfashionable because his flashy shoes gave him a dose of self-confidence when he needed them. *I guess that’s why they’re so expensive*, he speculated. When he looked up, his bag appeared in front of him. He grabbed it and left.

Indy stepped onto the Q70-SBS, almost greeting the bus driver before withdrawing so as not to bother him. He eyed an unattended pair of seats near the front, setting his suitcase in the luggage rack and sitting down. After taking his earphones out, Indy decided to relax and listen to a song before calling Sam. What would it be? He shuffled his music library, skipped a few songs, and settled on *Passionfruit* by Drake. A melancholy but pleasant song for his ride home.

As Indy looked out of the window from his seat, he took in his surroundings and absorbed the soundtrack. Passionfruit was about a deteriorating long distance relationship where trust and passion are jeopardized. He wondered: did he still trust his parents? When he was a child, their word was gospel, and he didn’t dare cross them. Now, he found it hard to imagine not lying to them. Of course, he had no choice with alcohol and drugs — he had to lie there. Indy wasn’t much of a drugs person, but he went out a lot at Stanford, and that entailed getting buzzed (or wasted) once or twice a week. He didn’t enjoy alcohol, or the weed that got passed around, but he didn’t regret adopting it into his lifestyle — Americans are so much easier to talk intimately with around alcohol. By the time he up and went to his first party, the standard and superficial friends he made in his dorms and classes greeted him with a warmth and enthusiasm he had never felt in the day time, even at intimate dinners and lunches. He wanted to keep feeling that, so he kept going out. He met Sam that way — they met through a friend at a party, and she made out with him that night. Talk about intimacy. Sam, too, he couldn’t mention to his parents. But if they asked, he could say the person calling is his friend Sam, and they’d assume she was a guy. That wasn’t not him lying, that’s their parents’ misplaced trust and ignorance.

Partying also led to his job situation, or lack thereof, which he’d have to lie about too. Last fall, he was too busy having fun to bother with recruiting, and the few companies that he talked to either didn’t offer a Visa or didn’t want to give it to him. Sam offered to let him stay at her house post-grad and pay for a couple classes, and he took it. Extra classes the next fall gave him the freedom to do whatever he wanted in his senior year, and it allowed him to distribute some of his academic load too. But his parents couldn’t know, because they’d scold him for wasting time and money; even worse, they’d ask him to stay with them.

Three things wasn’t too bad. *The rest I’ll try and tell the truth about*, he told himself. He was still fairly Muslim, and he took pride in his personal moral code. He tried his best. Satisfied with his intentions, he decided it was time to listen to Sam’s voice rather than Drake’s.

“Hey! You on the bus?”

“Yeah,” Indy said. “Hey, I miss you.”

“I miss you too!!” Indy couldn’t see, but Sam was beaming. Indy thought a lot about things, she could tell, but he didn’t talk much. So when he did show affection, she felt like a parched dog being given a bowl of water. “Dad asked about you yesterday. He wanted to know when you’re moving in so he can limit the Airbnb dates for our little shack.”

“I’ll probably come beginning of September, a week before classes start.”

“Okay. I think he likes you by the way. He said you’re smart.”

“No way. From that one dinner last week?”

“Dude, you had a 3.9 as a Computer Science major. That humblebrag was all the impression you needed.”

Indy chuckled. “You white people are so easy to impress, I swear.”

Sam scoffed in return. “You should be grateful! I have yet to meet your parents, you know.”

“Don’t. It’s not happening, Sam.”

“Ugh.” Sam had this exchange with Indy enough that it didn’t hurt her anymore. Still, she felt disappointed, and she pouted her lips out of habit. “Why are you so distant from your family, babe? Why can’t you call it home?”

“Do you really want to go into this?” Indy sure didn’t, but he already delayed it once.

“Yes. Please.”

“I don’t know. You’ve lived in Palo Alto your whole life, but I moved countries once I hit 13. I left Pakistan too early to call it home, and arrived in New York too late. And ever since we stepped in this country, the distance between me and my parents has increased. Each and every day.”

Sam didn’t respond, knowing her silence would encourage him to say more.

“I want their memory of me to be the Inzamam they knew in Pakistan. The one who prays 5 times a day, spends his free time studying, and couldn’t talk to a girl even if he wanted to. But college is where I found my true self. The one they can’t know about.”

“But you don’t have to lie to them, right? You guys can work through it.” Sam twirled her curled blonde hair. She was trying to be encouraging, but Indy seemed resigned as he spoke, and she felt guilty for bringing it up.

“There’s just too much dissonance. Why should I reconcile it with conflict and compromise when I can keep everyone happy? Their dear Inzamam got his degree in Computer Science from Stanford, is going to be a nice, successful Software Engineer, and once he gets his masters, he is going to marry a good Muslim girl from a good Muslim family. That’s the Inzu they want, and that’s the Inzu they get in the emails I send.” Indy shifted in his seat. “I hide myself because I love them. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t bother, and if I didn’t care, I wouldn’t send them these emails every month.”

“You realize you do have a degree in Computer Science from Stanford? You are going to be successful. Hope you’re not gonna marry someone else though. Hmm?”

“No, Sam.” Indy couldn’t help but smirk. He found it endearing that Sam was so committed to him, even in jest. “But chill. We’re barely 22.”

Sam smiled. “I mean, you don’t have to tell them everything, but you’re not exactly unemployed or dealing coke.”

“They think I’m still a virgin, babe. Once I tell them one thing, they’ll find the truth somehow. You don’t know my mom. She knows how to snoop and extort information from you. That’s why, ever since my freshman summer, I don’t call or text them. If there’s any real-time communication, she’d ask some questions, find something out that she doesn’t like, and I won’t hear the end of it. It has to be on my terms.”

“The summer your dad hit you?”

“All for finding a bong. I don’t want to talk about it.”

A thin silence dipped into the conversation for a few seconds.

Sam perked up. “Hey, no matter what you do, I love you. Just be good to yourself, okay?”

“Okay. Well, I’m almost here. I’ll talk to you later.”

“Good night! I love you.”

“I love you too.”

Sam hung up and realized she’d been cuddling her pillow the whole time. She thought of Indy, and how she loved that he would talk so freely if she asked the right questions. It was like a game, and she loved games. He kept her on her toes as she tried to time the right questions that would peel away Indy’s callous exterior and expose his curious and exotic self. She loved his body for that reason too; it was bulked, and his almond brown skin was hairy, but if you looked past that, there was a smoothness to it that even her hairless legs and torso didn’t have. She had a creeping suspicion that he used skincare products but denied it because it was off-brand. Ever since they met, she found herself wanting to find this smoothness and cultivate it — she wanted to comfort Indy and make him soft. Early in their relationship, she called him an almond because he was hard and tough, but silky smooth if you peel the shell away. And when they were together, he’d say that eating almonds would make her smarter. He was her almond.

Indy was a block away from the Jackson Heights stop when the call ended. Once he relaxed in his seat, he felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him. He’d been traveling the whole day, and part of him couldn’t wait to get back to his old house. Maybe his bed was still there, the one that was just stiff enough for his tastes, with the long body pillow he’d hug when he was a kid. Were the bedsheets light blue and the pillow green? Or his walls colored blue and his bedsheets green? He tried to imagine his room, a place that had left his mind 3 years ago, and couldn’t remember its details. He only remembered how it felt: tranquil but unkempt.

The bus arrived at the stop. He cleared his mind from the stresses and nostalgias that circled inside and left himself to observe the neighborhood. He got off, suitcase handle in his right hand and carry-on in his left, and listened to the song of Jackson Heights. He didn’t realize how much he’d missed the city that never sleeps, where you could sneak out at any time and feel alive. The car horns, people moving and talking, the rumble of the 7 flying above.

For tourists, New York City was a place to see: Central Park, skyscrapers, iconic landmarks, and of course the millions of people and thousands of restaurants. But for him, knowing New York came from listening to what it had to say, by learning its language and speech. Though it was a large city, if you listened close, you witnessed the smaller narratives at work around you. Indy’s favorite thing to do in New York was to stand still, back against a wall or storefront, and listen to people. The conversations you could tune into on the street, the one side of arguments and gossip you’d hear from people on phone calls, the occasional person yelling for whatever reason. He tried doing it in Palo Alto, but it was too polished, too placid. He would listen and listen, and nothing would come, except talk of the stock market, a company’s IPO, or new technology.

Once he reacquainted himself with Jackson Heights, Indy began the trek home. His house was North of the station, near Northern Boulevard. A 15 to 20 minute walk, if he recalled correctly.

His family should be expecting him — he sent an email a few months ago with his flight details, and his mom responded saying they’d “love to have him”. This was around graduation time, when he told them not to bother coming (especially since he was graduating in the winter). He felt guilty, though, so when Sam encouraged him to offer to visit in the summer, he did.

It was juvenile to talk to his own parents asynchronously like this, but once he cut them off, he never went back. He loved his parents, but was happy when their presence left his life. Once he felt free, he never wanted to feel restricted again, even if it was only through passive aggression or a watchful eye.
With each block he walked away from the station, his surroundings got darker and darker. By the time he got halfway to his place, he could barely see the color of own shoes.

Of course, this was New York, and Indy had never felt unsafe here. There were enough stores, bodegas, and restaurants to supply lighting, even if streetlights were few and far between. And no matter where he walked anywhere in the city, there were always people around, which put him at ease. It seemed the more lively a place was, the safer he’d feel.

But then it got quiet. It got eerie, even for a remote neighborhood far from the subway. And not just that, he’d been walking a while. He forgot the time he started walking — 11, 11:30? — but his phone said it was past midnight now. He’d started to wonder, did he go the wrong way? It had been a while, and he hoped he took a wrong turn. But just as he considered turning around, he saw his neighborhood’s bodega. It was there, but it was closed, the lights off. It used to run 24/7 — if anything, it closed well past 3 or 4 in the morning. But this was his bodega, he could tell by its obnoxious lettering and the *Halal Food & Deli* sign it had in the corner of the window. *Things have changed*, he thought, and he kept walking.

When he reached his neighborhood, it was dead silent. No lights except the moonlight were visible in the whole block. Indy was concerned. Was curfew this early now? He scurried to his apartment complex and looked inside. *No way. The lights are off in the lobby too. What the hell?* He turned on his phone flashlight and rang his family’s apartment number: 2E. No response. He pressed the button again and waited. Nothing. *Maybe the power went off?*

Thankfully, he still had his copy of the apartment keys. Holding his phone light with his left hand, he keyed in. The lobby looked the same as he had remembered it, at least from what he could see. The brown carpet was just as dull, and the old, droopy green couch was just as depressing. The flashlight added to the mood, like he was in those horror movies he’d watch with his friends. The lobby was empty besides the couch and mailboxes near the door. He walked, flashlight in hand, up the stairs and to the end of the hall.

Indy didn’t know what he’d expect when he got to the apartment, but he certainly didn’t expect it to be empty. Not void of things, but void of people. The unit was still furnished — not just furnished, it was intact, like it hadn’t changed since his high school. But what unsettled him the most was that the lights were left on. All of them. His dad would never let an empty apartment waste energy, and used to scold him for turning on the AC or leaving the kitchen light on. But when he walked in, he had to squint from the stream of light entering his eyes after being in the dark for so long.

He walked around the apartment, and marveled at how everything was left just as it was when he went to college. There were still leftovers in the fridge and dirty dishes in the sink. No one was here, though. He even checked under the bed to be sure.

*They must be out late, he thought. But where? Uncle Syed would know.*

Uncle Syed ran a halal cart five or six blocks from the apartment. He’d known his dad since they were kids. Indy checked his phone, which said it was one in the morning. If things truly hadn’t changed, Uncle would be at the same intersection, working his eight hour shift from 8 to 4.

Indy left his luggage in his room, and kept the lights on as he left the apartment. Something told him he should keep things the same.

As he walked to the halal cart, relief slowly washed over his anxiety. It was only his neighborhood that was dark; once he started walking to the intersection, the lights returned. People were still up and about and the bodegas were running. It felt normal again, thank God.
When he reached the intersection, he eased, and let out a hopeful sigh. The halal cart was still there. And was that Uncle Syed?

Uncle Syed looked visibly older, like he aged 20 years in the time between Indy’s high school graduation and now. When he was younger, he knew a man with rich black hair who laughed with the might of a beast. When Uncle Syed talked, you could feel the sound waves reverberate around you. Though his voice was deep, his stature tall, and his hair thick, he was the humblest man Indy had ever known.

Looking at him now, his beard had turned almost completely white, and he looked frail, even undernourished for someone who cooked for a living. He still had his resting smile, but it had decreased in intensity, settling for simplicity over delight. He had always been humble, but he truly looked the part now.

“Inzamam beta? Is that you?”

Indy was startled at Uncle Syed’s quick recognition. He thought he looked different, but Uncle saw right through it.

“Assalamualaikum, Uncle Syed. Long time no see. Hope you have been well Inshallah!” Indy felt obligated to act cordial and cheerful to compensate for Uncle Syed’s change in demeanor. After all these years, he found himself wanting to see his crooked teeth when he smiled, to hear his contagious laughter again.

“Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullah, Inzamam. It is good to see you, Alhamdolillah.” Uncle Syed cracked a smile of serenity, though his teeth weren’t visible yet. As he looked at Inzamam, he received a welcome dose of comfort and nostalgia. His features were just like his father’s. His brown eyes and sharp, thick eyebrows accentuated his confident demeanor, and his well sculpted beard made him look much older than he had remembered. Inzamam resembled his father now more than he resembled himself in high school. He had really become a man, Mashallah. The only features that came from his mother were his fair almond brown skin and round nose. Uncle Syed took a moment to reminisce; Inzamam’s parents were like his family, and he missed them already. He turned to Inzamam. “Have you just arrived?”

“Yes, Uncle. I am looking—”

“Would you like some food? Uncle still has the best lamb over rice in New York City.” Uncle Syed could see Inzamam’s restlessness. Did he not know?

“No thank you, Uncle. I am looking for my family. Do you know where they could be at this hour?”

Uncle Syed sighed and looked at Inzamam sympathetically.

“Beta, I haven’t seen them for months.”

“What? What do you mean? Are they on vacation?”

“Ahista beta.” Inzamam was visibly distraught, and Uncle Syed felt bad for him. What should he say? Syed was a compassionate man, but he was honest as well. “Beta, they’re gone. One day, they just disappeared, along with many people in that neighborhood.”

“They must have forgotten to tell you, Uncle. I’m sure they are visiting somewhere.”

“Inzamam beta, I have known your family for 30 years. Your father and my brother, inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon, were best friends in grade school. I have taken care of their children, you included, watered their plants when they were away, and even made sure they made it home safe after long road trips. But one day, they left, and they told me nothing. I do not know where they went.” Uncle Syed wished he could get out of the cart and comfort him, since the boy looked even more confused now. “I am sorry I cannot help you, Inzamam. Inshallah they will be back soon.”

Indy didn’t know what to do. He looked at Uncle Syed, smiled sheepishly at him, and said thanks. At least the house was still open.

“Wait, beta. At least take some food. Have you eaten?”

Indy wasn’t in the mood to take favors, but he was starving. “Ok, thank you Uncle.”

He took the lamb over rice plate from Uncle Syed, thanked him again, and walked across the street until he couldn’t see him. Once he reached a quiet corner, he sat on the pavement, Halal food in hand. Throughout Indy’s life, he’d been moving. When he was 7 and his family left their village to live with his uncle in Lahore. When he was 13 and they crossed the sea for a better life. When he was 18 and he fled to the other side of the country for college. For most of his life, Indy had been in a temporary state of leaving. But this time, for the first time, he felt he had no destination, no place to leave nor a place to go back to. Indy placed his food on the sidewalk and held his head in his hands. He was lost.
