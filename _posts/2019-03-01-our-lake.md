i remember our lake

stargazing on a friday night

ive been to many lakes since then

but that will always be ours

<br>
a silent date, dark with a full moon

i held you in my arms, you held me in yours

then, i knew

and i still know today

<br>
yet the lake is frozen

the chirp of the birds replaced with a piercing winter wind

the sky draped with clouds; no radiant sun, no full moon

the trees barren and stripped of their coats

a winter is snug, but not a winter like this

not one without you

<br>
i sit on the bank which kisses the ice

as the only living thing in sight

if life is movement,

i wait for the water to flow

for the radiant moon to circle the night sky,

for the trees to sway withÂ our hearts

so we may return to our lake

(when you are sure)

<br>
if life is movement,

i, too, am dormant

waiting for the river to melt

for the wind to caress and not pierce

for the winter to embrace and not smother

so we may return to our lake

at a better time: when you are sure

and i am happier

<br>
when you return,

all will move again

the sky will glow

the lake will sing

my heart will sway with yours

if you return, this place will breathe again

<br>
a better time, when you are sure

and i am happier

we will return to our lake

(i pray)

when you are sure

when i am happier
