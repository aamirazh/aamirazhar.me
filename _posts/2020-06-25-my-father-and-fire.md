I dreamt that my father was on fire. The backdrop remains the same — there is a car behind him, suggesting a street, which suggests a city and perhaps a set of witnesses, witnesses absent or invisible or engulfed by the fire too. The building behind him is black and white, as is the ground he stands on, but the fire is blood red and my father’s skin is the almond brown it always has been, even as the fire melts it into blood like a timelapse of a glacier melting or a cliff eroding.

I hated my father for his skin. I hated him for it while he was alive, and I shamelessly hated him for it when he died. Of course, hate for others necessitates a hate for oneself, more specifically, hate for the skin he passed down to me, which my fair-skinned mother had no part in. Southeast Asians are like that; it is a complete tossup whether you turn out brown or yellow—if such a distinction can, should, or would have been made without globalization or colonization—and because we are such mixed peoples, best friends, nephews, even siblings come out of the womb looking—to a Westerner—anywhere from Chinese to Indonesian to Indian.

That was strike one.

<br>
The second strike came another seven years after my birth. My father—his name was Simok, though it would soon become Sam—came home one day and gathered his children. It was 1998. My brothers and I were in the driveway kicking a soccer ball around. It was one of those soccer balls that had been used so much that its hexagons eroded and the outer layer peeled off as if it were scorched, the kind of ball with a life almost as long as one’s childhood, at least before they move and leave it behind. My elder brother—the light skinned one—was twelve. My middle brother was nine.

We lived in a house that was traditional enough to be on stilts, but modern enough to be made of, well, whatever modern houses were made of, perhaps wood or drywall, whatever pleased my seven year old self at the time. All I can say about that house is that it was white and fancy, it caught a breeze in the summers—the stilts helped with ventilation—and the driveway was just narrow enough that we might kick a ball into one of my mother’s plants and be grounded for the rest of the week.

“Come, my children,” Simok said. “I have something to tell you.”

We continued to play as my father watched us on the balcony. He looked young and peaceful, immortal; a silent siren, beckoning us, knowing he had all the time in the world to ruin us.

Simok laughed. “Vee, you must not kick the ball with your toes like that. It makes it hard to control.” The wind blew as he said it, like God was underlining his words, or maybe he was controlling the wind himself.

*Of course I know how to kick a ball*, I thought. *I feel like kicking it like this.* It gives me more power. I did not argue. He would never understand.

“Would you like me to show you?” The wind blew harder. The air was sultry, putrid, inhibiting us as we ran and kicked and pushed against it.

“No,” I said.

“Fair enough.” The wind relaxed. “You were always good at learning on your own.” It started up again.

The wind in those summers did not cool us. It was not refreshing. It was a prison, fierce and overzealous, uninvited and well-intentioned. When it was hot outside, it would come to us as solace, it would blanket us, and in its protection, it would suffocate us. The hot air would become heavy, and we would buckle and melt. Angle your body and fight, if you like. Run, walk, plant your feet against it. No matter what you do, it will only make it stronger.

I stood in the driveway in resistance. I angled my jaw downward and scowled. The wind was not upset; it was never upset. It pushed on in its eagerness. My father smiled as we played. My brothers covered their eyes as the dust flew in. I kicked the ball to send a message. I positioned my front toes before it and launched it forward.

The pot made a horrible sound as it cracked, like it was screaming, screeching against itself, calling for my mother’s vengeance in its last words. My brothers and I twisted our necks, deferring, as all kids do, to our father’s power and protection. The wind caressed our necks as we waited for instruction or retribution.

Simok raised his eyebrows. His short and parted hair rustled in the wind. He let his eyebrows fall, slowly, and smiled, as the wind rested on our shoulders. “We are lucky your mother is at the market,” he said. “I will fix it before she comes back. Come and sit with me now.”

Each of us responded differently to what my father said. He asked us if we had ever heard of America. Khai, the eldest brother, beamed. He said yes, he had seen America in the James Bond movie at the cinema. They have hot dogs and fancy cars and New York City. They play many sports, not just soccer. Baseball, basketball, football. Tai reserved his judgment, for he was the quiet one. He said, yes father, I have heard of America, we have learned about it in school. I said no. I said no, I did not hear of America, and even if it was a lie, I certainly did not care for it, and what can be the difference between knowing something and caring for it?

My father gave me a look that was at once loving and displeased. It was a look he gave me many times in my life, and the look—with his eyebrows disarmed and his mouth broken into a crooked smile—had the power to consume me at any point from my birth until the time he died. When he did finally die, I found myself longing for it, even if all it did was make me feel inadequate. Perhaps it made me feel precious, cherished, as well.

Let us talk about America, he said. Khai, you are right, America is in the movies. It makes many movies. Maybe you can be in one someday. Khai put on a look of awe and disbelief. Uncle Vien even said there is a children’s baseball league near him. Maybe you can learn. Khai’s smile and eyes widened even more. But we will not be living in New York City. We will be living in California with your uncle.

Tai, you might have learned about the war in school. Uncle Vien fled to America during the war. He has been living there for twenty five years and has invited us to come and stay with him. He says there is a lot of opportunity in the country. He says the schools are clean and the universities are world-renowned. If you study like you study now, maybe you can get into Harvard. Simok displayed a smile that communicated pride and expectation. Tai nodded.

My father turned to me. Come sit on my lap, Vee. Soon you will be too old to do so.

I shook my head.

Please. He rested his palm on his thigh and tapped his fingers on it, like he was calling for a cat. Do it for your father. And for a moment I felt that I was the father and he was the child, and that every parent needed their child just as much as they needed them, perhaps more, because a child can live without their parents but can a parent live without their child?

I sat on his lap, and he put his hand on my shoulder. Everything about him was gentle and it made me sick. Listen, Vee, he said. You may not want to go to America. God knows you do not like to follow anyone. But, Uncle Vien found a job for your father, and he thinks it would be a good opportunity for us all. For me, for your mother, and most of all for you three.

I know you may not understand, he said. You may not agree with me, and it is not fair of me to uproot our family from a place we have lived for centuries. But when you are a father, you will see. You will have to make difficult decisions that change the course of all your future generations forever. An infinite number of people. And no one will help you; likewise, no one will prevent you. You must simply do it, no matter how successful it might be or how equivocal your motivations are. You must trust me, Vee, in this decision. I do it out of love, and I am trying my best, as you are.

<br>
I wish I knew more of the war then. I wish I knew that America dropped two-hundred seventy million bombs on this country in the span of ten years. I wish I knew that Vien fled to the very country that was destroying us. I wish I knew that the nation my father spoke of so highly was the one that ruined us, was the one that told us to come to its shores for opportunity when it had taken it from us with its hands and guns, bombs and barbarism.

<br>
The third strike left me alone and resentful for many years after. It started when I was eighteen, in a summer where, perhaps for the first time, I felt—briefly—like I might have a life in this country. I had gotten into UC San Diego. I spoke the language well and had friends from junior year I played video games with. I was dating an American girl, a pretty one, and we spent the entirety of the summer together, knowing we would be apart at its end.

Khai was at home. He had graduated from CalPoly with a degree in business administration. In the daytime, he ate our food and lounged on our couches. At night, he hung out with his friends. He would come back only to sleep on our beds. My father let him waste our money like he had immigrated for nothing. He watched, patiently, understanding, and when I asked him to tell Khai to get his life together he simply nodded and said, “It will come. He is just going through something right now. We must let him live through it.”

<br>
He never did.

<br>
When my brother died, the light left my father’s eyes.

<br>
Simok was a lighthouse. I was a ship, lost at sea. Since I was young, he beckoned me to come to him, take refuge in his arms, to trust and love him and let him provide for me. I avoided him; perhaps I was searching for other lighthouses, perhaps I felt the need to press on, perhaps I did not know I was lost at all.
And then, his eldest son died, his light turned off, and he retreated into himself. Was it out of resignation? Hopelessness? Or was he simply extinguished and left to decompose?

Khai died from a drunk driver. He was speeding home from a party, he ran a yellow light, and he met the other driver at the intersection of misfortune and bad decisions.

It was misfortune for him and misfortune for us all, as Khai might as well have been a lighthouse to us too. He was the eldest, the treasured man, the one the girls liked, the ones the aunts spoke well of, the one the other boys were jealous of. When he spoke, his eyes lit up with fire, and you didn’t dare to turn away lest the fire spread and you were swallowed by his brilliant flames.

This country ruined him. It ruined him, then killed us, just as it did before, and as it would do again, undoubtedly, until we might finally fight back.
I would not like to speak ill of my brother. It was not his fault he fell prey to a country so malicious and cunning, that he adopted their practices and desires and let them destroy him. I think we all felt, after his passing: if not him, then how could any of us? What right did we have?

<br>
After I left for college, my father was alone. Tai had forgotten about us; he was studying and working in Massachusetts, a full and proud New Englandian. He had been offered a sip of success and prestige from this country and it had made him drunk, and now, in the most American fashion, he had forgotten about his family—the family who had brought him to where he was—and became too busy to visit.

I visited my parents every break I had—fall break, Christmas, spring break, and I looked for internships only in Sacramento too. Every time I saw my father, he aged twenty or thirty years. It was not his body that aged—to an American, he might have remained thirty-five or forty—not his forehead, neck, or fingers. It was his eyes. I saw it in his eyes, I saw him age and leave his body—inch by inch, word by word—each time I saw him. It was like they would retreat further into his head, and his pupils would disappear, and his eyes would become grey and unconcerned; every time I saw him, his smile became emptier, he would struggle to get up, he would sit in his bed and read, only getting up to pray or to watch or feed the birds in our backyard.

He did not tell me he would die too. Maybe I should have known, maybe I should not have been so naive in believing he would get better. But he should have told me. How could he not? How could he bring me to this country then leave me? How could he love me and not take me with him? I stood at his funeral as my mother wailed and my brother stared ahead blankly. I stood, and I thought, how dare he. How dare he.

<br>
I began having this dream, this dream of fire and love, years later, shortly after I had my first child. Each time I have it, I stare at his eyes as he burns, and he is alive. His eyes look like they did back home, before we left it and before I lost my father and oldest brother. All I can see are his eyes; all I can grasp is our eye contact. I cannot look away, until I realize myself and break to look for clues or something more, but at that moment—without fail—the dream ends, and I am left alone with my wife and daughter.

Simok did not talk much in the years leading up to his death. He asked about me, about us and our futures, but he did not speak for himself.

One summer Saturday morning, he told me I was his favorite. The gentle California sun touched our living room. It illuminated him, and I remember the light reflecting off the water in his typically dry eyes, the sun outlining him, underlining him and putting him in bold. It looked like he was producing the light himself, like he was the sun; that day, he was the only star I knew, and I was his.

That day, his eyes spoke to me: *Vee, I will be leaving soon, but I will live in you. Vee, I have failed you, but you must carry on. Vee, how cruel is it for you to be taken from your home and now it is too late to even go back? Vee, who are we to fight God’s will? Vee, you must carry on. Vee, you must carry on. Vee, give up on me, your brothers, your mother, but never give up on yourself. Vee, carry on and live. Life is too brief and sweet to waste away discouraged or vindictive. I love you, Vee. I love you and I should have said it when I took you from your home, I should have said it when your brother died, I should let you hear it before I die. I love you.*

I think of that day, and I think of this dream, my father engulfed in fire, the wind howling, wrestling the flames as they grow stronger and spread to the car and street alongside him. Simok is stoic; as his eyes melt, he knows; as his body burns, he waits, he waits as he does — waiting for the world to turn, waiting for nothing, always waiting and accepting. Always waiting, accepting, and knowing.
I think of this dream, I have it many times again, and I finally realize, looking closely: my father is not on fire. The fire comes from him.
