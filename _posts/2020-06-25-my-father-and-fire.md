I dreamt of my father on fire. The backdrop is always the same — there is a car behind him, suggesting a street, which suggests a city and perhaps a set of witnesses who are absent or invisible or engulfed by the fire too. The building is black and white, as is the ground he stands on, but the fire is blood red and my father’s skin is the almond brown it always has been, even as the fire melts it into blood like a timelapse of a glacier melting or a cliff eroding.

I hated my father for his skin. I hated him for it while he was alive, and I shamelessly hated him for it when he died. I hated him as I hated myself, my short and stubborn self with the wide nose, short neck, and pastel brown skin I inherited from him, untouched by my fair-skinned and congruous mother. It was a complete tossup whether I would turn out brown or yellow (if such a distinction could or should exist); my people are so mixed that cousins, nephews, even siblings come out of the womb looking—to an outsider—anywhere from Chinese to Indonesian to Indian.

That was strike one.

<br>
The second strike came another seven years after my birth. My father—his name was Simok, though it would soon become Sam—came home one day and gathered his children. It was 1998. My brothers and I were in the driveway kicking a soccer ball around. It was one of those soccer balls that had been used so much that its hexagons eroded and the outer layer peeled off as if it were scorched, the kind of ball with a life as long as one’s childhood, at least before you move and leave it behind. My elder brother—the light skinned one, Souvankham—was twelve. My middle brother, Orathai—we called him Tai, meaning rabbit—was nine.

We lived in a house that was traditional enough to be on stilts, but new enough to be made of whatever was considered modern at the time, perhaps wood or drywall, though I did not pay much attention to it at the time. All I remember about that house is that it was white and it caught a breeze in the summers—the stilts helped with ventilation—and that the driveway was just narrow enough that we might kick a ball into one of my mother’s plants and be grounded for the rest of the week.

“Come, my children,” Simok said. “I have something to tell you.”

We continued to play as my father watched us on the balcony. He looked young and peaceful, immortal, like a silent siren beckoning us. I glanced at him while playing, and it looked like he knew something. Even the sight of him filled me with determination. I felt I could do anything.

Simok laughed. “Vee, you must not kick the ball with your toes like that. It makes it hard to control.” The wind blew as he said it, like God was underlining his words, or maybe he was controlling the wind himself.

*I know how to kick a ball,* I thought. *I feel like kicking it this way. It gives me more power.* I did not argue. Perhaps I knew he was right.

“Would you like me to show you?” The wind blew harder. The air was heavy, putrid, inhibiting us as we ran and kicked and pushed against it.

“No,” I said.

“Fair enough.” The wind relaxed. “I know you prefer learning on your own.” It started up again.

The wind in those summers did not cool us. It was not refreshing. It was a prison, as fierce as it was uninvited. When it was hot outside, it would come to us as if it were solace; it would blanket us, and in its protection, it would suffocate us. We would buckle under the hot air; we melted under its weight. And yet, I came to miss the air during those summers in Laos. Something about its encompassing nature made me feel safe, even cared for.

I stood in the driveway in resistance. I angled my jaw downward and scowled. The wind was not upset; it was never upset. It pushed on in its eagerness. My father smiled as we played. My brothers covered their eyes as the dust flew in. I kicked the ball to send a message. I positioned my front toes before it and launched it forward.
The pot made a horrible sound as it cracked, like it was screaming, screeching against itself, calling for my mother’s vengeance in its last words. My brothers and I twisted our necks, deferring to our father’s power and protection. The wind caressed our backs as we waited for instruction or retribution.

Simok raised his eyebrows. His short and parted hair rustled in the wind. He let his eyebrows fall, slowly, then smiled, as the wind rested on our shoulders. “We are lucky your mother is at the market,” he said. “I will fix it before she comes back. Come and sit with me now.”

He asked us if we had ever heard of America. Khem, our eldest brother, beamed. He said yes, he had seen America in the James Bond movie at the cinema. They have hot dogs and fancy cars and New York City. They play many sports, not just soccer. Baseball, basketball, football. Tai, the quiet one among us, reserved his judgment. He said, yes pau, I have heard of America, we learned about it in school.

I said no. My ears were ringing and residual sweat collected on my shoulder blades. I knew it was bad news, so I said no. No, I did not hear of America, and even if it was a lie, I certainly did not care for it, and what can be the difference between knowing something and caring for it? I lived here, in Laos, on the outskirts of Luang Prabang. I walked to school on weekdays and we walked to the river on hot weekends, we played soccer in Loung Sing’s field when it was warm. What was America to me? What could it be to my father?

My father gave me a look that was at once loving and displeased. It was a look he gave me many times in my life, with his eyebrows disarmed and his mouth broken into a crooked smile. His eyes alone had the power to consume me at any point from my birth until the time he died. Once he finally left us, I would find myself longing for it, even if all it did was make me feel inadequate. Perhaps it made me feel precious, cherished, as well.

Let us talk about America, he said. Khem, you are right, America is in the movies. It makes many movies. Maybe you can be in one someday. Khem put on a look of awe and disbelief. But we will not be living in New York City. We will live in California with your uncle. Loung Vahn said there is a children’s baseball league near him. Maybe you can learn. Khem’s smile and eyes widened even more.

Tai, you have read about the war in the book grandma gave you. Loung Vahn fled to America during the war. He has been living there for twenty-five years and invited us to come and stay with him. He says there is a lot of opportunity in the country. He says the schools are clean and the universities are world-renowned. If you study like you do now, maybe you can get into Harvard. My father displayed a smile that communicated pride and expectation. Tai nodded.

Simok turned to me. Come sit on my lap, Vee. Soon you will be too old to do so.

I shook my head.

You were always the difficult one. He smiled to himself, then rested his palm on his thigh and tapped his fingers on it, like he was calling for a cat. Please, Vee. Come.

I could not understand it then, but a pebble implanted itself into my heart at that moment, and it would grow from a brief suspicion to a vision—a dream, or a nightmare—where I was the father and he was the child, where I had to provide for him, where he needed me just as much as I needed him—perhaps even more, as a child can live without their parents but a parent cannot dream of losing their child.

I sat on his lap, and he put his hand on my shoulder. The ringing in my ears quelled, like there was a swarm of bees leaving my mind, and the trees outside began to sway. Everything about him was gentle — I could not live without his soothing voice. Listen, Vee, he said. You may not want to go to America. God knows you do not like to follow anyone. But, Loung Vahn found a job for your father, and he thinks it would be a good opportunity for us all. For me, for your mother, and most of all for you three.

I trusted him.

I know you may not understand, he said. You may not agree with me, and it is not fair of me to uproot our family from a place we have lived for centuries. But when you are a father, you will see. You will see that these decisions are not ours to make after all.

<br>
I wish I had known of the war then. I wish I had known that America dropped two-hundred seventy million bombs on this country in the span of nine years. I wish I had known that Loung Vahn fled to the very country that was destroying us. I wish I had known that the nation my father spoke of so highly was the one that ruined us, was the one that told us to come to its shores for opportunity when it had taken it from us with its hands and guns, its bombs and barbarism.

<br>
The third strike was not so much a strike but a slow and agonizing death and longing. It started when I was eighteen, in a summer where, perhaps for the first time, I felt—briefly—like I might have a life in this country. I had gotten into UC San Diego. I spoke the language well and had friends from high school I played video games with. I was dating an American girl, a pretty one, and we spent the entirety of the summer together, knowing we would be apart at its end.

Khem was at home. He had graduated from CalPoly with a degree in business administration. In the daytime, he ate our food and lounged on our couches. At night, he hung out with his friends. He would come back only to sleep on our beds. My father let him waste our money like he had immigrated for nothing. He watched, patiently, understanding, and when I told him Khem needed to get his life together he only sighed and said, “It will come. He is just going through something right now. We must let him live through it.”

<br>
He never did.

<br>
When my brother died, the light left my father’s eyes.

<br>
Simok was a lighthouse. I was a ship, lost at sea. He had beckoned me to come to him, take refuge in his arms, to trust and love him and let him provide for me. I loved him—I had known him—and then I was lost. I hit the rocks and still kept searching for his light.

Khem died from a drunk driver. He was speeding home from a party, he ran a yellow light, and he met the other driver at the intersection of misfortune and bad decisions.

It was misfortune for him and misfortune for us all, as Khem might as well have been a lighthouse to us too. In Laos, he was the eldest, the treasured man, the one the girls liked, the one the aunts spoke well of, the one the other boys were jealous of. When he spoke, his eyes lit up with fire, and you did not dare to turn away lest the fire spread and you were swallowed by his brilliant flames.

And then, we came to America, and he left himself.

<br>
I first realized that Khem was Khem no longer in June 2004. Six years had passed since we had immigrated. Khem was nineteen and had started college; he developed an obsession for fashion and inserted the n-word into every other sentence he spoke. Tai had just turned sixteen — he had braces and hogged the computer every night to play MapleStory. I was fourteen, and I remember nothing of myself then except that I wore hats or beanies to hide my horrible hair.

Earlier that month, Spider-Man 2 had come out. Tai loved Spider-Man more than he loved us, and my father loved Tai even more. “Let us go out for Tai’s birthday,” Simok said. His eyes were filled with pride and he drove with his left hand on the steering wheel. “He deserves a celebration for all the hard work he has been doing.” He reached over and patted Tai’s knee. Tai nodded and let a grin escape his short and symmetrical face.

The movie theater close to our house was small and unimpressive. In just a few years, it would go bankrupt, and an AMC would pop up in the mall nearby along with an Urban Outfitters and an Anthropologie. On Tuesdays, they had a family night, where tickets were half off for groups of four or more people. Simok bought the tickets two weeks in advance and we arrived forty minutes before the movie started.

“Can we get popcorn, dad?”

“No, Vee. Popcorn makes you thirsty and then you will be wanting a Pepsi as well.”

“Pau, I won’t ask for Pepsi, I promise. I am hungry and mae did not give me the granola bar with lunch today.” I did my best to look innocent; I wore a curious and needing face like I did when I was younger, when I wanted a toy from the store or a treat from the talat sao in Luang Prabang.

“I am sorry, Vee. A popcorn is the price of one ticket. You can eat when we get home.”

I sulked and slowed my pace while my father went ahead to the theater. “Why didn’t you get a ticket for mau then?”

“She did not want to come, luk la. You know she does not care for American cinema.”

“Then why can’t we get popcorn?”

“Shut up, Vee,” said Khem as he bumped past my sluggish walk.

“You shut up,” I said. I walked ahead to bump past him but my neck hit his elbow and I groaned.

“Stop whining,” Khem said. “You’re embarrassing all of us.” He looked back towards me and I saw a glimpse of fire; I saw his eyes spark as they did in Laos. Something was calling me. The lights in the theater dimmed and the ground became still as if an earthquake had just passed and I was finding the ground again. The people became faceless and I saw his eyes and I walked towards them. I struck him in the chest—with all the force of my fists—and a match struck somewhere and his eyes erupted in flames. I saw Khem, my brother, my dear ai nyai, in his fullest self, and I realized then that he had been missing and I wanted him back.

But the match went out, the flames quelled, and my brother looked American again. His white windbreaker was like a straitjacket inhibiting him; I wanted him back. I stomped on his feet—on his off-whites—and I got what I wanted. He punched me in the face and I smiled. He pushed me down and I felt alive.

“Luk, oh my God what are you doing?” My father stopped and helped me up, his eyes flowing between concern and judgment.

I thought Khem would argue with him. Tell him I stepped on your shoes, I thought. Tell him I punched you and you had to do something.

“Pau, I am sorry. I don’t know what came over me.” Khem looked at the floor and started walking, and we followed him. “It won’t happen again.”

 My father felt no need to discipline him. He felt no need to discipline any of us.

<br>
Halfway through the movie, Peter Parker quit being Spider-Man in order to reconcile with Mary Jane. Khem went to the bathroom then, and after thirty minutes, he still hadn’t come back. I went out looking for him, leaving Spider-Man to stop a train going off the rails.

I had imagined him smoking outside, in a car long gone, or otherwise lost in another theater or the mall or someplace else entirely. Instead, I saw him as I exited at the snacks counter near the entrance. I jogged towards him—I wanted popcorn or some sour patch—but then I stopped. He was leaning his elbows on the counter and his legs were trembling on the balls of his feet. His eyes were shy and he was blinking a lot; he scratched his head and looked at the floor. He was speaking to a girl behind the counter who I recognized but could not identify. She was pretty; she wore a plain, oversized black hoodie with a nametag on it, her hair was tied up with a few strands of hair hanging over her face that she would move to the side every so often, her fingers were smooth and spotless like a baby’s and her nose was short and narrow. She was smiling at Khem as he smiled at her, but his was a longing smile and hers was nostalgic: pity, it almost felt like pity for her to be looking at him like that, as she moved between the food stations and touched up the snacks while Khem followed her like a dog.

He didn’t notice when I walked closer to them. I bought a coke and popcorn two registers down, settled at the soda fountain closest to them, and watched and listened to them as they spoke.

“Just while I figure things out.” She had a soft voice, a white, feminine manner. Khem watched her as she spoke. “I’m just doing this because I have nothing else to do.”
“I like college. My classes are interesting and I feel like I have changed already.”

“Really? That’s good, Khem. That’s really—”

“I just, just the other day, I was just thinking about that, you know, like how I used to be a lot more immature and now I feel that I am more present, you know.” Khem leaned into the counter and the girl leaned back and fixed her posture. Her look of pity returned and I heard the cars honking outside. Someone passed me on the soda machine and when I looked back they had disappeared. “Just like you said, I think I’m more present. I almost feel bad, you know, I could have been better to you then, and—”

“Oh, Khem, please, it’s okay; I’m not upset about—”

“No, really, I think I could have given you so much more than I had, than I could give now, and I just wonder if I did, then…” his voice trailed off and he was looking at his shoes again. The girl scowled and her face produced a shadow. She looked away.

“Khem, please… I don’t want to do this right now.”

“I’m just saying, that’s it, I don’t know what else to—”

“No, like I just can’t do this, I’m sorry Khem, I…”

They both went silent. The cashier across was staring at me. I pretended to look at the candy on display next to my brother. I hoped Khem didn’t look around.

“I didn’t want to tell you this,” she said slowly, like she was lecturing a child. “But I’m dating someone else now. I’d love to talk to you but I can’t.”

“Is he going to get upset? Why? Does he hurt you?”

“No, what? Khem, please, I think it would be easier if we just don’t. I—this is why I blocked you, I knew you would—”

“Do what? Why is he trying to control you? I can talk to him, Lucy, I know how to handle these things, just—”

“Are you ready to go?” Someone came into frame. I didn’t notice him until he talked. He stood next to Khem—he was three, maybe four inches taller than him—and looked at the girl. “It’s eight o’clock.”

She said nothing. Neither did Khem.

“Sorry, sir. Were you about to buy something? The churros are outside.” I remember I could hear him so clearly from where I stood. I felt enraged and I did not know why; the man’s voice bounced off the walls and filled the room. He looked at Khem, he looked him up and down — did he know? He adjusted the collar of his button-up. His hair was gelled in the middle and he had a fade on the sides.

“No, sorry,” Khem said, and my heart sank. “Just looking.” He started to turn around, and I jumped up and walked to the bathrooms. I didn’t look back. I wonder if he saw me and was too ashamed to call me out.

That night, I saw him cleaning his shoes. He smelled of weed and self-pity. He did not look back at me as I watched. He might as well have died then.

<br>
I would not like to speak ill of my brother. Things were different here. He received stares as he did in Laos, but they were empty — they were looks of fear, not reverence. They stared because of how he looked, not who he was, not the fire he held in his heart that erupted through his throat and out of his mouth and eyes. Khem rebelled against their condescension by letting it consume him. He bought new clothes. He went to parties. He learned the slang and hooked up with American women. He became obsessed with image. He thought it would give him status.

Khem had a choice between power and agency. He chose power, then he lost himself and was left with nothing but hedonism. He might have known, as I did, that he was not being himself. How can you be proud of something that is not yours?

This country ruined him. It ruined him, then killed us, just as it did before, and as it would do again, undoubtedly, until we might finally fight back. I think we all felt, after his passing: if not him, then how could any of us? What right did we have?

<br>
After I left for college, my father was alone. Tai had forgotten about us; he was studying and working in Massachusetts, a full and proud New Englander. He had been offered a sip of success and prestige from this country and it had made him drunk, and now, in the most American fashion, he had forgotten about his family—the family who had brought him to where he was—and became too busy to visit. Simok not once uttered a phrase of disapproval, even as he crumbled. Perhaps it is what he wanted.

I visited my parents every break I had—fall break, Christmas, spring break, and I looked for internships in Sacramento too. Every time I saw my father, he aged twenty or thirty years. It was not his body that aged — he might have remained fourty-five or fifty, if you were an American, if you only looked at his skin, forehead, chest or fingers. It was his eyes. I saw it in his eyes, I saw him age and leave his body—inch by inch, word by word—each time I saw him. It was like they would retreat further into his head, and his pupils would disappear, and his eyes would become grey and unconcerned; every time I saw him, his smile became emptier, he would struggle to get up, he would sit in his bed and read, only getting up to pray or to watch or feed the birds in our backyard.

I visited because I had to. I was doing for my family as my father did for us, before we came to this wretched country, before my family fell apart before my eyes. I helped my father with citizenship applications, I nursed him while he was sick, I worked in the summers to pay his bills. I did everything for him and everything for my family, but what could one man do against a country? I could do nothing as my father died. He did nothing either; he did not even tell me he would die too.
How could he? How could he bring me to this country then leave me? How could he love me and not take me with him? I stood at his funeral as my mother wailed and my brother stared ahead blankly. I stood, and I thought, *how dare he. How dare he.*

<br>
I began having this dream, this dream of fire and love, years later, shortly after I had my first child. Each time I have it, I stare at his eyes as he burns, and he is alive. His eyes look like they did back home, before we left it and before I lost my father and oldest brother. All I can see are his eyes; all I can grasp is our eye contact. I cannot look away, until I realize myself and break to look for clues or something more, but at that moment—without fail—the dream ends, and I am left alone with my wife and daughter.

Simok did not talk much in the years leading up to his death. He asked about me, about us and our futures, but he did not speak for himself.

One summer Saturday morning, he told me I was his favorite. I remember how the gentle California sun touched our living room. He was illuminated, the light reflecting off the water in his typically dry eyes, the sun outlining him, underlining him and putting him in bold. It looked like he was producing the light himself, like he was the sun; that day, he was the only star I knew, and I was his. He felt like home. All I wanted was his embrace again.

“Luk la, you are growing taller by the year. Soon you will be towering over your mau.”

“Luk la, can you promise me you will take care of your mother when she is older?”

“Luk la, I know you will carry on our family name. You are more capable than you think.”

He spoke to me that day, but I did not listen. I did not want to hear his words. I wanted him to take me into his arms and tell me it would be alright, that he was just sick and adjusting to this country, that he would come back and lead us to our destiny.

That day, his eyes told me he would die. But I did not believe him. I heard I was his favorite and everything would be alright.

<br>
I think of that day, and I think of this dream, my father engulfed in fire, the wind howling, wrestling the flames as they grow stronger and spread to the car and street alongside him. Simok is stoic; as his eyes melt, he knows; as the streets catch on fire, he watches; as his body burns, he waits, he waits as he does — waiting for the world to turn, waiting for nothing, always waiting and enduring. Always waiting, watching, enduring, accepting, knowing.

I think of this dream, I have it many times again, and I finally realize, looking closely: my father is not on fire. The fire comes from him. And I feel it in me too.
