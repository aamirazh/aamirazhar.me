Smoke rises from the ground and I walk alone among the uniform, black sky. I am alone; not even the stars can see me, and all I hear are screams from underground. When I press my heel against the concrete, the earth ripples, splitting out into veins that lead North and South, the formless future and the urgent now.

*Demanding*, I whisper. *Demand from me*, it shouts. And my eyes follow its veins to the places I may belong, but I standâ€”all I do is stand until my knees buckle and I fall into the empty earth.
