in front of me is a valley

infinite, desolate, but eerily hopeful

i look at the horizon and see the sun rising slowly

it calls to me

i feel it call to me

i sprint.

<br>
as i run

it asks to sit down

it says “there is nothing out there"

“why chase something that only exists in your head?”

but this is how i feel

<br>
as i run

i look to the sky

and see points of light unseeable from the industrialized world

i map the stars to constellations

forming signs to aid me on my journey

“this isn't anything real”

but this is how i feel

<br>
as i run

i see resting streaks of light

left behind by previous dreamers

the paths nurture lush greenery

sprouting and growing from light

i feel connected to the runners

we are one in our journey to grasp the unseen

yet i am far from them

this is how i feel

<br>
as i run

i find new paths

only seen to me

and i lose old paths

that do not wish to have me

i feel lost and frustrated

but still determined

this is how i feel

<br>
as i run

i reach a waterfall

it speaks to intimidate

but i know it is gentle

it tells me it leads to other worlds

i jump.

as gravity pushes me down

i realize i do not control where the world chooses to make me go

i let it swallow me

this is how i feel
