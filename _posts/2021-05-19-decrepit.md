Metallic fumes rise from the concrete. The grasses sway in and out of the shade of the trees above them. Sirens yell from far away. Potholes litter the road; our legs walk around them and I watch them pass then disappear into the horizon.

The sun burns its light into my skin. I’m changing. I’m old. I’m stained. I will be thrown away soon. I will be replaced by something contemporary.

Ages pass in the form of months. My life cycle is short. Fashion changes. Colors change. People change. Like a fruit fly, the sun I’m born into may be the last sun I see.

When we arrive inside, I take one last look at the sky. The sun has waned; the moon is waiting to come out. I whisper a goodbye to the grass—soon, God willing, I will decompose under their roots.

<sup>*From a writing prompt from class: Choose an object that is meaningful. Take the object on a walk. Make sure your object can “see.” If you're feeling bold, hold it out in front of you as you walk. Write from the perspective of the object, or from the perspective of the environment. I wrote about the Nike pants I've been wearing a lot this past year.*</sup>
