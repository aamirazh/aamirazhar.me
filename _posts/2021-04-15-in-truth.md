In truth, I’m falling

deep in the ravines

The world keeps taking—

give it all of me

<br>
Blue masks unfaltered

swimming underground

Deep, uncut longing—

let it let me drown

<br>
Soft teeth shine at me

Bite into my skin

Red eyes see through me—

Never try to win

<br>
Plain strength like water

Lower and unfelt

Love you forever—

‘til I meet my end
