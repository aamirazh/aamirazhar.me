The buildings are occupied by green fungi and a stench of resignation. Our heads are down. The computers are faster than us. Their faces are brighter. We’ve completed it. Our hearts are aching. Our consciences are heavy.

Screams from outside fill our ears with curses and mourning. Our heads remain down. Our hearts ache. Our spirits twist in knots.

The old is dying. Its hull is colored with rust and the engine is stalling. The screens flicker. The roofs we built cave in on us, but our desks might keep us sheltered.

The new cannot be born. But it watches us as we think of it. We need not see it but in our hearts. We’ll take back our land from the old. We’ll give our lives back to the new.

The old is dying; the new cannot be born. But it trembles. It yells in its womb, its soul bursting out from its throat. The walls around it will melt from the inside and we’ll watch its eyes as it’s swallowed once again. What will we do?

The old is dying. The new—it must be born. Now.
