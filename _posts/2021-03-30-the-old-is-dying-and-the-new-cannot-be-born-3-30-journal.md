The buildings are occupied by green monsters and a stench of resignation. Our heads are down. The computers are faster than us. Their faces are brighter. We’ve completed it. Our hearts are aching. Our consciences are heavy.

Screams from outside fill our ears with curses and mourning. Our heads remain down. Our hearts ache. Our spirits are twisted in knots.

The old is dying. Its hull is colored with rust and its engine is stalling. Our roofs cave in on us but our desks will keep us sheltered.

The old is dying. The new cannot be born. The old is falling, the new is left unfound. Destruction, determined, continued, built on top of, then torn down again—is the new on the horizon? Or is it a mirage?

The new will wait for us as their buildings collapse and tremble. It will wait when they give us back our lands and people. Our eyes are closed while we dream of the new. We need not see it if it’s hidden in our hearts.

The old is dying, and the new cannot be born. But it trembles. It yells in its womb, its soul bursting out of its throat. The walls that imprison it melt from the inside and we will glimpse its eyes as it’s swallowed again. What will we do?

The old is dying. The new—it must be born. Now.
