i want to be better

everything looks foreign

i want to be better

everything looks foreign

i want to be better

everything looks foreign

everything looks foreign

i feel so small

i want to be better

everything looks foreign

i want to be better

everything looks foreign

i want to be better

why do i feel so close to death in times like this

everything looks foreign

i want to be better

everything looks foreign

i affirmed life, i did

i want to be better
