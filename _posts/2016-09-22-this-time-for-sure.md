***Aamir â€¢ scrobbling since 4 Sep 2013***

It's been three years since I started using this website. Three years since she asked me to make an account so she could see what my music taste is like. Three years since she secretly thought it was pretty shit, but never told me.

It's been three years since I last decided to unlock my heart again, since I tried to believe that love could exist, again. Since I told myself I got along with her in a way I never got along with anyone else, that we just got each other.

It's been three years since I opened my mind up to experience music other than just pop, punk rock, and hip-hop. I've always loved music, but she showed me a whole new dimension of it. It became an essential part of my life, and something I'll always be indebted to her for.

It's been three years since I tried so hard to care for someone else. We lived really far away, and it was clear that wouldn't change at least for another year or two. It's been three years since I last believed that no matter how crazy or hard it was, it could work out. This time, for sure.

It's been three years since I last felt that kind of comfort with someone. We'd talk every night before sleeping, and every morning on our way to school. Three years since I had that much hope.

<br>
It's been two years since I last felt the tragedy of dying love. Since I felt the hopelessness of a deteriorating relationship. It felt like you were holding a handful of sand, but it kept slipping through your fingers, just a little at a time. "It's just sand," you'd think, "I can keep it together." But you couldn't. No matter how hard you tried.

It's been two years since I realized you can't choose love. That no, you can't just "work through" everything, no matter how hard you try.

It's been two years since I decided relationships were messy, not worth the stress, and overall a bad idea. Two years since I decided staying alone was the best course of action, especially going into college.

It's been one year since I truly got over her. One year since listening to the music she showed me didn't give me really bad anxiety and immense loneliness. (I still feel that way sometimes, but at least it's independent of her now.) One year since I felt free, independent, and strong again.

<br>
It's been six months since I met someone else. Six months since "her" started representing someone different for me, and stopped representing my scarring past relationship. Six months since that random lunch where we clicked, ever so cautiously.

It's been four months since we started talking regularly. Four months since we started getting absurdly and abruptly close. Just four months since we were so excited to talk it only took us a few weeks to know all about each other's past hers and hims. But summer was starting, and we had to say bye, despite there being so much more to talk about.

It's been one month since I told her I really liked her. One month since we reunited after summer, as if we knew each other for years. One month since my heart asked me why I'm doing all of this again. But I had to leave again, since I was spending the semester away. It's been one month since I last looked in her eyes and felt so much hope.

It's been one week since I decided I want to be with her. Since I decided that no matter how hard it could be, it'd work out. Since I decided that love does exist, and that she held the key to opening it up.

<br>
It's been three years since I last believed these things. Three years since my last leap of faith, though it feels like yesterday. But, I know this girl is special. And I'm so much different than I was three years ago. I'm mature, I'm confident, and I'm ready now. This is what I've been looking for, I know it.

This time, for sure.
