The sky fell like a blanket onto my body. It feels reminiscent of a time once passed; I gaze into its constellations and blue-orange colors flood my eye.

In the center of the universe there is an egg. As time passes and rewinds, it stirs; its shell is iridescent, its shape confused and unformed.

The galaxy looks like a bagel, and in its center is the pattern of a bee—striped black and yellow with translucent wings stretching out of its hull. It looks like it is floating, but it isn’t. It is moored in gravity and it rests upon itself.

The severance of the stars feels like a heart being taken from its body. It is liberating to be free—but it lies stunned, unsure of where to go and oblivious as to why it has left in the first place.
