every night

when the sun disappears

i think of you

i recreate your feel

and i wrap it around me

<br>
but it's been so long

i forget

how it feels

to touch your hair

how it feels

to look straight

into the light of your eyes

<br>
you are more than a person

you are an environment

you are a world

a climate emanates from you

like mist from warm water

<br>
and though i am so far

i can still feel it from here

your passion

your laugh

your stubbornness

your frustration

your vulnerability

<br>
i want to step closer

i want to touch you

i want to tell you words no one else has

tell you i know it's hard sometimes

but you are appreciated

and you are special

<br>
time is just a construct

it's one i will dismantle

i will hold it in my hands

bend its laws

stretch its fabric

all to be with you

<br>
and when i am

we will collide

our airs will mix in a flurry of emotions

and form a soft tornado of passion

we will sit

and we will exist

<br>
i will brush your cheek

and the universe will quiver

touch your neck

and mountains will dissipate

hold your hand

and monsters will tremble

i will kiss you

and the earth will be eclipsed

<br>

i miss you.
