My mother.

Who would she be if she was not?

If I passed by her on the street, or I

Met her in the mosque.

<br>
Would she be more carefree?

Would she smile more or less?

Would she be in love?

Would her heart be uncompressed?

<br>
Could she write?

Play the piano, act or teach?

If she did not marry after college,

If she did not have to care for me.

<br>
Could I still admire her,

Would I admire her more?

Would her soul flow and her mind be freed

If she had room to soar?
