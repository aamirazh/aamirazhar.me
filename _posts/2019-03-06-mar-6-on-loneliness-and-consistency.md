As you probably know if you actually read my blog, I was in Durham for an oral surgery up until a couple weeks ago. Not gonna lie, it was a nice excuse to be at home with my family (as opposed to being alone in NYC). Home is nice precisely because of its familiarity. You always know, at the end of the day, that your parents will be sitting on the couch with the cat (your dad checking emails on his laptop), your youngest brother will be playing DS in His Spot, your cousin will be studying in the formal dining room, and your middle brother will be playing video games upstairs.

It's like clockwork. And I like clocks. You always know what will happen when. In a half hour, the minute hand will do half a rotation around the clock face. A clock will never sneak up on you after half an hour and send you a long message about what's wrong with your politics. It'll never decide, at 8pm on a weeknight, that it doesn't really want to talk to you and it has its own things going on. It won't seenzone your messages or ask your friends if they think you're a little weird, no? Nope, a clock has one job. It moves its hands the same amount every second, every minute, every day. It neither exceeds nor falls short of your expectations. Isn't it nice?

Especially last year, dealing with these feelings of isolation and loneliness, I began to rely on coming back to Durham and experiencing familiarity. An air of Comfort, of Consistency, of Unconditional Love. I began to think, as I felt my grasp on life loosen, that familiarity and consistency was just something I needed in life, that internal consistency cannot exist without external consistency. That unknown variables and risky endeavors weren't for me. Going out my comfort zone was fruitful, and I don't regret the times I've done it, but it was never sustainable, and it was always stressful. Just temporary, right?

I do think my feelings were valid, no doubt. At the time, I was experiencing a complete loss of control in my life, so it would make sense for me to try and regain it. To stick to what was familiar, to rely on loved ones hundreds of miles away, to vent continuously on Facebook video chat until I felt enough intimacy and support to go on with my life in NYC.

During times like that, of stress and isolation, I tend to think continuously about periods in my life where I'm very independent, when I'm way out of my comfort zone, fundamentally alone. Times like my first two years of high school, my freshman year of college, my semester abroad in Jordan, where I find myself in these foreign spaces yet I find a feeling of internal consistency such that I end up being fine on my own. I don't look back at those times with a sense of understanding, even a sense of longing, I look upon them with a sense of profound confusion. How the hell did I go to Morocco for 6 weeks without feeling a strong sense of loneliness? How did I have basically 0 close friends in my freshman year of college yet I managed to push on and find meaning in the things I did anyway? In times of extreme loneliness, like after moving to NYC, I think about those times and wonder if that was even the same Aamir I knew. I try to replicate the feeling to no avail. Maybe those days are over. Maybe I had some weird emotional awakening and now I rely on my loved ones too much. Maybe I'm approaching a time in my life where I need to settle down. God knows.

But when I get out of that thought process, I realize that those periods of independence and self-fulfillment are always preceded by a struggle. In Jordan, my first couple weeks included some of the worst spurts of anxiety and loneliness I've ever had. Other times, that internal consistency is just a lie—just laziness repackaged. In my freshman year of college, I was happy on my own, but I also had a lot of spurts of anxiety I didn't understand. I wasn't self aware enough to ask myself what I made me happy, so I just played video games and numbed my feelings. Is that what I really want? I know that being self aware, going outside my comfort zone, and even just asking these questions is immensely hard. With the process comes great struggle, no doubt. But as my therapist says, it's normal. It's expected. Is it worth the stress? Will a rainbow appear after the storm? A part of me says yes; it's worth it. But honestly, I can't say for sure. Maybe ignorance truly is bliss.

But what truly blows my mind is that no matter what, things improve. During times of anxiety, I try to tell myself that life will get better, but I almost never believe it. I mean, why the hell would my anxiety just leave? Why would I stop feeling lonely unless my life changed in a material way (new close friends, different living situation, etc)? It just doesn't make logical sense. Clearly the way you solve anxiety and loneliness is you.. solve the problem. You stop being lonely. You find some people to rely on or something. You get a new job, move to a new city, I don't know. Your material situation has to change, right? Problem is, this mentality—unacceptance of the status quo, a need for a change—can result in desperation. I mean, it's often necessary; this mentality gave me the motivation to find a therapist, to build friendships with people I barely new in NYC, to start attending random events to meet people. But it also avoids the problem somehow. It reduces emotional unrest into a logistical question.

And I realize now, it's never logistical. It's not a formula where we solve for x, which represents the number of friends we need to be happy, y which represents the hobbies we need to keep up, z which represents the amount of times we need to go out in a week to feel socially satisfied. It isn't something to be "solved" at all.

There are times when I feel a still, deep peace in my heart. And when I do, I look around at my world.. and I realize not much has changed. In fact, if you look at things externally now, things could seem even worse. I'm not relying on my loved ones as much anymore, a couple of my closer friends in NYC are gone or have gotten busy, my team moved to a new building so I don't have anyone to get lunch with anymore. But those things don't matter. The sandstorm whirling around me needs not shake up my sense of inner peace. Now, of course, it's probably slightly easier to have an internal peace when there isn't a sandstorm whirling around you. But over time, our skin hardens, our eyes learn to see squinting, our hearts beat stronger. We manage to find an inner peace amongst the chaos. We always do.

So maybe, when our life is chaos, the answer is not to immediately try to sort it all out. Ironically, it's not to look outside at all. The answer is to look to the inside. Talk to your heart. Nurture your soul. Focus on the small things. Those moments I feel peace, they don't happen after a big life event. They don't happen after I win a big prize, land a great job, when I'm winning life. It's when I sit with myself and the world is still and I can feel my heart beating. It's when I listen to a song that moves me, write a piece of poetry I am proud of, when I have a tiny (but somehow loving) conversation with the barista at a coffee shop. Things don't have to be great for me to be well. They need only be delicate.

It's only now that I understand why. I often underestimate myself. I really do. I underestimate my ability to adapt, I underestimate my ability to find self-love and self-consistency, I underestimate my ability to find meaning. And I don't think it's unique to me. I think humans in general are more adaptable than we give ourselves credit for. We can always find a life for ourselves no matter what kind of situation we find ourselves in, no matter how crappy it gets.

Of course, my situation is different than being forcibly evicted, homeless, or starving, so I can't say what that's like. But my point is humans endure. We endure and we get used to things. It sucks sometimes, but we keep pushing somehow. I firmly believe that we are much stronger than we think.

And I'm not saying that anyone could just uproot themselves at any point in life and expect no side effects. I'm saying that we're creatures of habit, of routine, and that humans have a unique ability to adapt into homeostasis in almost any environment they're presented with. I guess that's why we're such Powerful Animals. When we reach into ourselves, sometimes there is nothing but dust, and life is strenuous and confusing. But if we harness our internal self enough, slowly, we can see that dust turn into pure, radiant gold.

I'm still struggling. I feel lonely now and then, some weeks I seem to lose my motivation, and crises present themselves in my life fairly frequently. Even when I started writing this piece last week, I was doing much better, while this week has been one of the hardest ones in a while. But still, I remain positive about the process. I look back and see how much progress I've made, and trust that I will continue to find my sense of self, despite the occasional (or frequent) setback.

For one of the first times in the past year, I begin to gaze into the void not with a look of aimlessness and distress, but with a look of confidence, even a look of excitement — excitement to unpack and understand the immense worlds I face on the outside, as well as—*especially*—on the inside too.

I'd like to close this brief and unedited blog post with a quote I came across reading the Daodejing (with commentary) recently. As I'm trying to fully embrace this Early 20s Vibe of Finding Yourself, I found it to be profound and encouraging. I'd love to explain the quote entirely in the context of Daoist philosophy, but that's out of scope of this post, and I'm getting tired :) Feel free to message me about it though!

> We all possess something good and noble that we don't have to seek outside ourselves, something that the glory of power or position cannot compare with. People need only start with this and cultivate this without letting up. The ancients said, ‘Two or three years of hardship, ten thousand years of bliss.’

#### <sup>-Huang Yuan-Chi, Daodejing (Red Pine version, commentary)</sup>

<br>
Two or three years of hardship, ten thousand years of bliss. I keep my shoes tied, chin up, and my eyes on the road. I cultivate a renowned faith in myself, a trust and endurance that I know will last through the worst hardships of anxiety and loneliness. And whoever's reading this, I hope you nurture that self-trust as well. Remember! Self-love is important, but self-trust.. self-trust is absolutely necessary.
