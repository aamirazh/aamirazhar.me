Who am I if I am not there for the ones I love?

Who would I be if I disappear when they need me most?

Fame, reputation, influence, but what for if at the cost of those closest to me?

Why succeed if I cannot spend it with them?

To live a meaningful life is to prioritize the deep, the divine, the most vulnerable over the normal, the established, the structured.
