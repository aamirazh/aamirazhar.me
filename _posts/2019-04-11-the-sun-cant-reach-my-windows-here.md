i would close my blinds

in the room i called home

beige walls, crooked posters

but t'was a world that i owned

<br>
i loved in that room

i escaped from outside

out was calm green and warm sun

but i cared none to try

<br>
now life is loud, filled with chaos

but i look out, i look around

i raise the blinds in my great hope

but the sun cannot be found

<br>
the sun can't reach my windows here

not even the nights here moonlit

i'm lost, but enclosed, in my world

my soul trapped but adrift

<br>
i once was told of a world

one soft and sympathetic

now i can come to face it

but it's just cold and traumatic

<br>
the sun can't reach my windows

peace is gone from my life

i look out, and i see madness

i look in, see sorrow and strife

<br>
where is love? where is laughter?

where is the life i was promised in youth?

i long for things i've never had

i wish for things i cannot choose

<br>
dreams of freedom and security

i yearned for what wasn't enough

for what's freedom without exploration?

security with no one to love?

<br>
slaving for a living

or fully out of work

alive with no meaning

awake but still inert

<br>
we struggle through this life,

blind, scarce hope at our chest

but it's a dreary routine

settled only with death

<br>
what's a life we can't cherish?

one toilsome but compact

life starves us of love and affection

then leaves us once to pass

<br>
the sun can't reach my windows

it's dark outside and in

my world is all extinguished

my patience, it runs thin
