I don't really like populism, at least in its current form. It can be inaccurate in its claims, inconsistent in its platforms, and dishonest in its exploitation of American insecurities. However, it's been working. And I think that's largely due to the disconnect between "bourgeoisie" politics and the average American (though Trump is a bourgeois as well, don't forget). Populism exploited this disconnect and "checked" the current state of our politics. Though populism is often unstable, often not worth it, and often dangerous, it can be a balancing reminder to how we approach politics.

And it is no secret that American liberals need that check. When progressiveness is often associated with being educated, and anyone conservative is labelled as "stupid", you know we've kind of forgotten what we're about.

See, being progressive, on an ideological level, should have nothing to do with being smart, or well-read, or anything, in my opinion. And being conservative shouldn't have a monopoly on being pro-working class, or anti-establishment. In fact, for me, leftist ideologies can be more anti-hierarchy and pro-proletariat (heh) than right-leaning ones are. But, in America? Liberals are too smug for that. Being progressive is a cool kids club. It's Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. And if you're not in the club, well, you're not a cool kid and we don't want anything to do with you. There's a great read called <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism">"The smug style in American liberalism"</a> that explains this so well, I would definitely recommend it.

#### <sup>This article, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism">The smug style in American liberalism</a>, is a great read for all. Would recommend.</sup>

Now, there is a reason liberals can be like this. It is because **being progressive has become more about "knowing" and less about "doing"**. So all you have to do is believe everyone should be equal, believe that Muslims aren't terrorists, and believe that white people are privileged, and congrats, you did your job. You're in the club. You just gotta vote and you're good (or maybe even voting isn't necessary).

This makes liberalism in America very vague, and very pretentious. It is, in other words, not organized. It isn't action-oriented. In this sense, American vague liberalism is similar to many online leftist forums I read. It's just so ideology driven, and many don't recognize the necessity of current action, regardless of its exact associated political ideology. See, the thing about action-oriented movements is that they are much more fluid. Anyone can participate in a rally, an event, or initiative, and as such, it's easier to ease into the movement. With ideology-based groups, it's so explicit, and it seems more closed off to outsiders.

This brings me to my point. The reason Trump won was less about any inherent conservative ideals. It was about *organizing*. It was about having demands, validating an identity, and making a voice heard. Say what you will about Trump's campaign, but it gave us a loud and clear narrative of white identity in America, especially among the working class. Though I think Hillary was more than qualified for the job, and I think she was unfairly criticized and attacked, she just wasn't able to organize people like Trump did. She was just that vague, safe, liberal candidate that we have so many of. To the average person, she didn't seem to have specific demands besides "freedom for all" and such. We didn't actually know much about her, or more accurately how we relate to her. And again, though she didn't deserve it, this made it harder to rally people behind her, because no one really felt like their voice was being amplified by her. She was just more of the same.

#### <sup>Trump gave people an identity, or a cause, to rally around. He made (\*some*) people feel like he was amplifying their voices.</sup>

And so, as minorities, as progressives, or whatever, it is essential for *us* to organize ourselves to make our voice heard. And though protests, in my opinion, are justified, I think it's important to have certain ideas, demands, or identities to rally around. Something to say and convey, if you will.

I'll give you an example. College can be a bubble, but it's really taught me how organizing can work. See, when someone organizes a social movement, a protest, or even just support around a specific demand, the first priority is action. And so, if you are willing to commit to the idea, then you're welcome. It doesn't matter where you come from. It doesn't matter if you watched John Oliver's latest sketch making fun of Trump. Don't really listen to NPR? Who cares. As long as you're willing to put effort into the cause, you work with others and work to further educate yourself, and you don't get in the way, then great.

(Emphasis on that last point. Don't get in the way. If it's a movement around police brutality against black communities, and you're white, you can be an ally, but don't take the stage. Understanding where you stand in different social issues, what your lane is, and how to express solidarity is essential.)

#### <sup>This was a protest I was a part of last spring at Duke. I know this protest was slightly controversial, but it gave me insights into social organizing and pushing demands, and I think the cause was definitely justified. If you have any questions about this protest, feel free to Facebook message or tweet at me.</sup>

Now, Trump managed to organize people in what seemed like a more action-oriented way. But, the problem with him is his movement inherently thrives off exclusiveness and fear. Yes, Trump managed to rally, unify, and organize people under a "movement", but he did it under rhetoric that was clearly exclusionary, dangerously nationalistic and xenophobic, and exploitative of American insecurities.

Not all political or social organizing need be like that. It is possible to organize people over ideals that deconstruct power rather than reinforce it.. but it's harder. It's harder because it's uncomfortable. It requires an unlearning of internalized discrimination, and a critical, yet open-minded approach to issues. And most of all, it requires a willingness to sacrifice personal power for the common good, which means stepping down when you should, amplifying others' voices, and again, staying in your lane. If people don't do this, hierarchies and power dynamics can be reestablished and the movement may lose its equality-oriented grassroot-ness.

This is not to mention the difficulty of being both an open movement that people can learn about, as well as a strong-willed one. I mentioned before that action-oriented can be better for outsiders to ease into. And I do believe that it's important that people, when seeing movements and initiatives, can feel comfortable inquiring about the movement, have outlets to get educated on it, and get involved themselves. However, organization should also be firm and uncompromising on our identities and the freedoms we deserve. And it can hard to both be organized and strong, while still being accommodating and open.

#### <sup>I know BLM can be controversial (as many social movements are) because of a few instances of rioting done in its name and an accused lack of organization, but I really look up to it as a strong modern social movement. It may not have had clear demands, or centrality (which is arguably unnecessary), but it had a specific message, and people were able to present it in a strong and meaningful way. It got people talking, and led to people educating themselves (or their friends) on police brutality and anti-black racism in the United States. Again, if you have any questions about BLM you want answered, feel free to Facebook message or tweet at me. But it's better you ask someone else who represents the movement better, I'm just an ally.</sup>

And I know it sucks. It sucks that minorities have to do so much. We have to be strong and uncompromising on our equality, but also patient and willing to talk things out with people. We have to show our frustrations, but not scare anyone. And this is all while hurting, mourning, and healing from the oppression and discrimination we face on a daily basis. It sucks, and I'll admit I still don't know how to best express myself and my opinions.

I'm just a kid. I don't have all the answers. But, no matter what, we have to start organizing, and we need all the help we can get. We have to take this into our own hands, make our voice heard, and make real progress. Because voting is not enough.

It has never been enough.
