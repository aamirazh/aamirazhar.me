When you weave my hair, my mind eases into the body. My heart flutters and my lungs fill slowly with air. My stomach stirs and my liver purifies my blood. My legs stop shaking and my toes curl into the balls of my feet.

The bread we ate for lunch moves from my stomach to the small intestine. The braids of my hair touch my back, in between my shoulder blades. My skin sheds; my fingernails grow past the tips of my fingers. My eyelids pass over my eyes, my nose wiggles gently, and my mouth opens to let in the pitted plums you feed me. My larynx shifts and expands, my vocal cords rub against each other, as air escapes from my lungs through my trachea into my mouth and out of my lips to craft the sound:

*I love you.*
