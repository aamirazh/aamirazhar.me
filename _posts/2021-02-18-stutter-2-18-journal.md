The engine’s stopped, though it didn’t stutter. It sighed and relaxed as if it was turning in bed. Water and smoke lined its lungs, and the spark in its heart was submerged and suffocated.

The engine had been tired, but it didn’t know to stop. It was programmed to run. Why would they program it to rest? A resting machine is a bad one, washed up.

The rain stopped an hour ago. The air is warm and humid, and the earth is taking a deep breath. Soon, flowers will sprout from the ground and trees will provide shade from the oppressive sun. But for now, there is only the machine, left to die in the wreckage of this abandoned city.

The billboards have since peeled off. Mounds of sand have invaded the buildings; oil and dirt accumulate in the streets. The machine is sitting alone. No one watched it work, and now no one watches it die.

Cough. The fluid is accumulating in its lungs. Cough. They watched the engine when it was made. Cough. Then, they put it to work, and it was never touched again.

The machine wonders if it will be remembered. It wonders if anyone will know its pain. It works now harder than ever—when it is dying, and yet its structure refuses death. This is its best work. Its best work is done before it dies. Its best work is done alone.

The machine coughs again, and then it stutters, finally. It feels a sense of loss and longing, and then it passes. It is ready now.

It stutters again. It stutters again. Stutter, stutter, until the water explodes out of its lungs and its body takes a deep breath. The heart jumpstarts and the body is triggered into motion. The machine rises. It moves. In the deconstruction of this empty city, it works.
