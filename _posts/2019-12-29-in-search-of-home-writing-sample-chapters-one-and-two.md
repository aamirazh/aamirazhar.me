### 1 | New York City
Home is an enigma. It is simultaneously within our control and without, in such a way that we cannot choose where we are born but we may choose where our children are.

As we move around cities, countries, and continents, we find that people and places have gravity. These gravities intersect and create winds and hurricanes of family, employment, relationships, lifestyle, and education. They pull and push us, as they pulled and pushed those before us, to move, and keep moving.

There is a certain strength in calling a place home. It is a statement of intent. You may not be living there — many call faraway lands or places they cannot visit home. But in calling something home, you proclaim that it holds a place in your heart, and that it will continue to do so. You establish it as a body of gravity in your life, something that pulls you—however strong—to it. Home is a body; it has a presence; it demands to be considered, esteemed, and loved. In this sense, the word *home* carries with it a sense of romance, that even if you are not together, you loved it once, and you long for it at times. That even as you are apart, you think of it fondly sometimes, you hope it is doing well, and sometimes you entertain the idea that if your paths cross, that love may be rekindled again. Love is gravity, gravity is love, and home embodies both. You will yearn for it at times, and while you may not understand it, your heart will embrace its call. It searches for home, whoever, whatever, wherever it can be.

When Inzamam went to see his family the summer after graduation, he didn't think of it as going home. He told himself it was a visit, a trip, maybe even a vacation — but no, it was not a homecoming.

And when he stepped off the plane at LaGuardia Airport, he didn’t feel relieved. He felt resentful towards his girlfriend for convincing him to go; he felt tired and annoyed from consuming the whole day flying. He hadn’t talked to his family for years, and though he knew his streak would have to end eventually, he didn’t want it to happen then.

For this was his summer, the summer after graduation when he’d become an adult. What could be more destructive to this process of self-actualization than visiting his parents, a pair of people who saw him as a being to be nurtured and cared for? He felt no autonomy at home, and he knew he wouldn’t feel it now, no matter how much older he thought he was.

*LaGuardia is a mess of an airport,* he thought to himself. The moment he walked off the jet bridge into the terminal, the chaos, sonder, and clamor of New York City came flooding into his mind and heart. People were talking loudly, yet they were quiet and self-absorbed; they were looking straight at him and faintly into the distance all at once. Though Inzamam would never admit it, he held a nostalgia for New York, the kind of nostalgia anyone would acquire from their formative years, even if he recalled much less about middle and high school than he did college or even his childhood.

And though he would never talk about New York glowingly the way other New Yorkers did, or talk about it with malice like they did too, he believed in truth that it was the ideal place to come of age because it pushes you. It packages such overwhelming options and noise in its exterior such that the only way to sort it out is to look to your interior. You can’t handle anything, until you can, and by then you know yourself.
New York was where a fresh and immaculate immigrant learned to breathe, both in providing his body with air as well as letting it go. He took this breath and its elasticity into his college years, content with and intent on staying in the company of his own thoughts and affections — his, and his alone.

Though he had since distanced himself from his father, he heard his voice in his head: *What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger!* In this respect, Inzamam agreed, and when he wasn’t avoiding the thought, he fantasized about raising his kids in the city. *Maybe in Sunset Park or something,* he thought, *whatever is furthest away from Jackson Heights.*

<br>
As he walked down the stale, slate walkway to the baggage claim, his phone buzzed in his pants pocket. He slowed with a mild annoyance matched by those who had to walk around him, then transferred his beige tote bag and carry-on to his left arm and took out his phone.

“Baaaaaaaabe!”

“What is it, Sam?”

“You told me you’d call me when you landed! It’s already 10 there and I was getting concerned…”

Inzamam stuck the phone between his shoulder and right ear and rubbed his right eye, still drowsy from his nap on the flight.

“Yeah, well, I’m a bit busy here,” he said.

“Your flight go okay? I miss you, Indy!” Sam made a smooching noise that reminded him of the kissing and smiling heart face emojis she put at the end of her texts to him.

“It was fine. Just long, and the whole day is gone.”

“You sound tired, babe. But how does it feel to be home? I miss you already.”

<br>
Suddenly, thousands of miles away, Indy could see her curious face asking him this question, and he realized he missed her too. When she asked questions, her accented eyebrows would raise, relax, and give way to her perfectly rounded brown eyes. She had a distinct face — a thin but sharp nose, an almost right-angled jawline — but when she talked to people, she would soften these features somehow, and others would ease around her. Sam had a way about her, where she would act and look so innocent you couldn’t help but lean into the conversation. Not out of pity, but because you wanted to satisfy her, to see her tentative expression turn into realization, fulfillment, and even ecstasy in completing the picture she was constructing in her head.

But at heart, Indy knew Sam was strong and sovereign because when she slept, her complexion returned to a hardness she’d never let emit in the day. She looked abnormally serious in her sleep, and when you caught her dreaming, she’d almost look disturbed. He wondered if she knew, if she held that understanding of herself, or if it was something only he and maybe her mother had witnessed.

“This isn’t my home. You know how I feel about this.” Indy stepped on the escalator leading down to the baggage claim.

“Do I? You never talk about New York, Indy. All I know is that you hate it, apparently.”

“Well, Palo Alto is my home, if I had to choose one. I guess.”

“What? Palo Alto is so boring, babe. You can’t choose Pakistan or New York? You’ve lived longer in those places than you did in Palo Alto.”

Indy yawned. He didn’t feel like defending himself.

“Listen, can I call you back? I just got to the baggage claim and I need to get on the bus.”

“Of course, love. Call me when you’re on. I love you.”

<br>
Sam was cheerful and excited. From her couch in her white bedroom in her family’s white ranch-style home in Palo Alto, she waited in anticipation for his call. It had been a long day, not the kind that was busy but the kind that was empty, drowsy, and dry. Her couch was brown, but her walls and other furniture—desk, coffee table, bookshelf, drawers, and bedsheets—were white, the “I got this new from IKEA” kind of white that she loved. The wall across her couch was littered with pictures of them together, one batch arranged in an S shape and the other in an I. *It’s been almost two years,* she thought to herself, *and I’m still in love with him.* She truly loved Indy, and what she loved even more was learning about him. The highlight of her day was talking to him, and she called spontaneously twice a day (any more than that and he’d start to get annoyed).

For Sam, that’s what love was — attention, acceptance, and affection. She could never describe the way she felt, or tell you the difference between love and attraction, but she used the L-word freely from early on in their relationship. She did because every time she said “I love you”, it comforted her. It convinced her that this was something special, that it was real, and that she wanted him. It felt good to want someone else, and even though Indy didn’t say it back half the time (especially at first), she didn’t mind. The act of saying it was affirmation enough, and she trusted that he loved and cared for her in his own endearing and elusive way.

Sam sunk into the couch and opened her book again. Etched on the cover were the words *Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity.* Above the title was the author's name, *Katherine Boo,* and the words *NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER.* Sam's right hand clutched the waist of the book, her manicured fingers grasping the little girl on the cover, as she mustered up strength and attention to finish another page or two.

<br>
Back in New York, Indy sighed as he waited for his bag to appear on the conveyor belt. As he hand-combed his long, curly hair, he looked down at his black jeans and his white and light blue Nike Reacts. He didn’t care much for fashion, but he still liked looking at his shoes from time to time. He only wore jeans with solid colored polos or crew necks — today, it was a grey Ralph Lauren — but he was never insecure about being unfashionable because his flashy shoes gave him a dose of self-confidence when he needed them. *I guess that’s why they’re so expensive,* he speculated. He looked up, and his bag appeared in front of him. He grabbed it and left.

Indy stepped onto the Q70-SBS, almost greeting the bus driver before withdrawing. He eyed an unattended pair of seats near the front, setting his suitcase in the luggage rack and sitting down. After taking his Airpods out, Indy decided to relax and listen to a song before calling Sam. What would it be? He shuffled his music library, skipped a few songs, and settled on *Passionfruit* by Drake. A melancholy but pleasant song for his ride home.

As Indy looked out of the window from his seat, he observed his surroundings and took in the soundtrack. *Passionfruit* was about a deteriorating long distance relationship where trust and passion are jeopardized. He wondered: did he still trust his parents, whom he'd been separated from for years? When he was a child, their word was gospel, and he didn’t dare cross them. Now, he found it hard to imagine not lying to them. Of course, he had no choice with alcohol and drugs — he had to lie there. Indy didn't even like drugs, or smoking, but he went out at Stanford, which entailed getting buzzed (or wasted) once or twice a week. He didn’t *enjoy* drinking alcohol, or smoking the blunts that were passed around sometimes, but he didn’t regret adopting it into his lifestyle — Americans, Sam included, were so much easier to talk intimately with around alcohol. Once he up and went to his first party, the superficial friends he made in his dorms and classes began to greet him with a warmth and enthusiasm he had never felt in the day time, even at compared to intimate dinners and lunches. He clung to that feeling like it was a lifeline. He even met Sam that way — they met through a friend at a party, and she made out with him that night. Talk about intimacy.

Sam, too, he couldn’t mention to his parents. But if they asked, he thought, he could say the person calling is his friend Sam. Most likely, they’d assume she was a guy due to their own misplaced trust and ignorance, and he wouldn’t correct them. Indy smirked at his own cleverness, then felt a tinge of guilt.

Partying also led to his job situation, which he’d have to lie about too. Last fall, he was too busy having fun to bother with recruiting, and the few companies that he talked to either didn’t offer a visa sponsorship or didn’t want to give it to him. Sam offered to let him stay at her house post-grad and pay for a couple classes, and he agreed. He delayed recruiting and redistributed some of his academic load, and then he had infinite freedom to do whatever he wanted in his senior year. But his parents couldn’t know, because they’d scold him for wasting time and money; even worse, they’d ask him to stay with them in the summer.

Three things wasn’t too bad. *The rest I’ll try and tell the truth about,* he told himself. He was still fairly Muslim, and he took pride in his personal moral code. He tried his best. Satisfied with his intentions, he decided it was time to listen to Sam’s voice rather than Drake’s.

“Hey! You on the bus?”

“Yeah,” Indy said. “Hey, I miss you.”

“I miss you too!!” Indy couldn’t see, but Sam was beaming on her couch. Indy thought a lot about things, she could tell, but he didn’t talk much. So when he did show affection, she felt like a parched dog being given a bowl of water, especially in this torrid and lonely summer after college.

“Dad asked about you yesterday. He wanted to know when you’re moving in so he can limit the Airbnb dates for our little shack.”

“Uh, I’ll probably come like at the beginning of September, a week before classes start. I can give you exact dates tomorrow."

“Okay. I think he likes you by the way. He said you’re smart.”

“No way. From that one dinner last week?”

“Dude, you had a 3.9 as a Computer Science major. That humblebrag was all the impression you needed.”

“White people are so easygoing,” Indy said. “One number and they’re happy.” He chuckled.

“You should be grateful! I have yet to meet your parents, you know.”

“Don’t. It’s not happening, Sam.”

“Ugh.” Sam had this exchange with Indy enough that it didn’t hurt her anymore. Still, she felt disappointed, and she pouted her lips out of habit. “Hey, Indy?”

“Hm?”

“You distance yourself from your parents more than anyone else I know. It’s unsettling, sometimes, you know.”

“Sam, you’ve lived in Palo Alto your whole life. I moved countries—”

“Here we go.”

“—once I hit twelve. Like, it’s like I left Pakistan too early to call it home and arrived in New York too late. And ever since we stepped into this country, the distance between me and my parents has increased. Each and every day. Sometimes I feel it isn’t even my choice.”

Sam had heard this before, but she wanted to hear it again. She knew her silence would encourage him to say more.

“I want their memory of me to be the Inzamam they knew in Pakistan. The one who prays five times a day, spends his free time studying, and couldn’t talk to a girl even if he wanted to. But college is where I found my true self. The one they can’t know about.”

“But you lie, Indy. Why do you lie?” Sam twirled her curled blonde hair. She was trying to be encouraging, but Indy seemed resigned as he spoke, and she felt guilty for bringing it up.

“Their dear Inzamam got his degree in Computer Science from Stanford. He is going to be a nice, successful software engineer, and once he gets his masters, he is going to marry a good Muslim girl from a good Muslim family.” Indy’s voice evened out. “That’s the Inzu they want, and that’s the Inzu they get in the emails I send. I hide myself because I love them. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t bother, and if I didn’t care, I wouldn’t send them these emails every couple months.”

“You realize you do have a degree in computer science from Stanford? You are going to be successful. Maybe not marry someone else, though, hmm?”

“No, Sam.” Indy found it endearing that Sam was so committed to him, even in jest. “But chill. We’re barely twenty-two.”

Sam smiled to her phone. “I mean, you don’t have to tell them everything, but you’re not exactly unemployed or dealing coke.”

“They think I’m still a virgin, babe. Once I tell them one thing, they’ll find the truth somehow. They’re overbearing and they think I’m an extension of them. That’s why I ghosted them.”

Sam’s voice softened. “Was that when your dad hit you after freshman year?”

Indy raised his eyebrows. “How did you know that?”

“You told me once. Sorry if it’s sensitive, I don’t mean to—”

“It was all for finding a bong, if you need to know. I don’t want to talk about it.”

A thin silence dipped into the conversation for a few seconds.

Sam perked up. “Hey, no matter what you do, I love you. Just be good to yourself, okay?”

“Okay." Indy was glad to change the subject. "How are you doing? Is home good?”

“Home is fine. But it’s so goddamn boring. I’ve just been binging Breaking Bad and—”

“You’ve never seen Breaking Bad?”

“No. Anyway, I was saying—”

“What season are you on?”

“Just three.”

“Oh man. Have fun. It gets good.”

“Yeah. Well, I only really see my parents in the evenings and my high school friends on the weekends. It’s really dry. I just want to start working, you know? Also, I miss you.”

“...”

“...Indy?”

“Yeah? Yeah. Sorry, a bit tired. Keep going.”

“I was just saying I miss you.”

“I miss you too, Sam. Really.”

“Okay,” Sam sulked a bit. “Well, I’m sure you’re tired. Good night!”

“Good night. Hey, I love you.”

“Aww… I love you too. I love you lots!”

“Night, babe.”

<br>
Sam hung up and realized she’d been cuddling her pillow the whole time. She thought of Indy, and how she loved that he would talk so freely if she asked the right questions. It was like a game, one requiring strategy and sharp thinking. They talked about him more than they did her, but she preferred it that way. He kept her on her toes as she tried to time the right questions that would peel away his callous exterior and expose his curious and mystifying self. She loved his body for that reason too; it was bulked, and his almond brown skin was hairy, but if you looked past that, there was a smoothness to it that even her hairless legs and torso didn’t have. She had a creeping suspicion that he used skincare products but denied it because it was off-brand. Ever since they met, she found herself wanting to find this smoothness and cultivate it — she wanted to comfort Indy and make him soft. Early in their relationship, she called him her almond because he was hard and tough, but silky smooth if you peeled the shell away.  And when they were together, he’d always be snacking on almonds, always saying that eating them makes you smarter. *Indy, Indy,* she'd say as she'd poke his nose or kiss his cheek. *You are my almond.*

<br>
Indy was a block away from the Jackson Heights stop when the call ended. Once he relaxed in his seat, he felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him. He’d been traveling the whole day, and part of him couldn’t wait to get back to his old house. Maybe his bed was still there, the one that was just stiff enough for his tastes, with the long body pillow he’d hug since when he was a kid. Were the bedsheets light blue and the pillow green? Or his walls colored blue and his bedsheets green? He tried to imagine his room, a place that had left his mind years ago, but he couldn’t remember its details. He only remembered how it felt: tranquil but unkempt.

The bus arrived at the stop. He cleared his mind from the stress and nostalgia that circled inside and let himself observe the neighborhood. He got off, carry-on handle in his hand and tote bag on his shoulder, and listened to the song of Jackson Heights. He didn’t realize how much he’d missed the city that never sleeps, where you could sneak out at any time and feel alive. The car horns, people moving and talking, the rumble of the 7 flying above.

For tourists, New York City was a place to *see*: Central Park, skyscrapers, iconic landmarks, and of course the millions of people and thousands of restaurants. But for him, knowing New York came from listening to what it had to say, by learning its language and speech. It was a large city, and very loud, but if he listened close, he could witness the smaller narratives at work around him. Indy’s favorite thing to do in New York was to stand still, back against a wall or storefront, and listen to people. The conversations he’d tune into on the street, the one side of arguments and gossip he’d hear from people on phone calls, the occasional person yelling for whatever reason. He tried doing it in Palo Alto, but it was too polished, too placid. He would listen and listen, and nothing would come, except occasional talk of the stock market, a company’s IPO, or some routine party going on that night.

<br>
Once he reacquainted himself with Jackson Heights, Indy began the trek home. His house was north of the station, near Northern Boulevard. A 15 to 20 minute walk, if he recalled correctly.

His family should be expecting him — he sent an email a few months ago with his flight details, and his mom responded saying they’d “love to have him.” This was around graduation time, when he told them not to bother coming (mostly because he was graduating in the winter). He felt some remorse, so when Sam encouraged him to visit in the summer as compensation, he went with it.

It was juvenile to talk to his own parents asynchronously like this, but once he cut them off, he never went back. He loved his parents, though was happy when their presence left his life. Once he felt free, he never wanted to feel restricted again, even if it was only through passive aggression or a watchful eye.

With each block he walked away from the station, his surroundings got darker and darker. By the time he got halfway to his place, he could barely see the color of own shoes.

Of course, this was New York, and Indy had never felt unsafe here. There were enough stores, bodegas, and restaurants to supply lighting, even if streetlights were few and far between. And no matter where he walked anywhere in the city, there were always people around, which put him at ease. The livelier a place was, the safer he’d feel, and New York was lively, everywhere.


But then it got quiet. It got eerie, even for a remote neighborhood far from the subway. And not just that, but he’d been walking a while. He forgot the time he started walking—11, 11:30?—but his phone said it was past midnight now. He started to wonder, did he go the wrong way? It had been a while, and he hoped he took a wrong turn. But just as he considered turning around, he saw his neighborhood’s bodega. It was there, but it was closed, the lights off. It used to run 24/7 — if it did close, it was past 3 or 4 in the morning. But this was his bodega; he could tell by its obnoxious lettering and the *Halal Food & Deli* sign it had in the corner of the window. *Things have changed,* he thought, and he kept walking. He hadn’t followed Halal since three summers ago. *I have changed too.*

When he reached his neighborhood, it was dead silent. No light except the moonlight was visible in the whole block, and Indy was concerned. Was curfew this early now? He scurried to his apartment complex and looked inside. The lobby was dark too. He turned on his phone flashlight and rang his family’s apartment number: 2E. No response. He pressed the button again and waited. Nothing. *Maybe the power went off?*

Thankfully, he still had his copy of the apartment keys. Holding his phone light with his left hand, he keyed in. The lobby looked the same as he had remembered it, at least from what he could see. The brown carpet was just as dull, and the old, droopy green couch was just as depressing. The flashlight added to the mood, like he was in those horror movies he’d watch with his friends. The lobby was empty besides the couch and mailboxes near the door. He walked, flashlight in hand, up the stairs and to the end of the hall.

Indy didn’t know what he’d expect when he got to the apartment, but he certainly didn’t expect it to be empty. Not void of things, but void of people. The unit was still furnished — not just furnished, but intact, like it hadn’t changed since his high school years. But what unsettled him the most was that the lights were left on. He couldn’t see it from the street—the windows were on the other side of the building—but everything was still on. His dad would never let an empty apartment waste energy, and he would scold Indy for leaving the AC or kitchen light on. Yet when he walked in, he had to squint from the stream of light entering his eyes after being in the dark for so long.

Indy walked around the apartment and marveled at how everything was left just as it was when he went to college. There were still leftovers in the fridge and dirty dishes in the sink. No one was here, though. He even checked under the bed to be sure.

*They must be out late,* he thought. *But where?* Indy pondered for a second on the couch, his right leg shaking and his left hand cracking its own knuckles. He thought of something. *Uncle Syed would know.*

<br>
Uncle Syed worked at a halal cart five or six blocks from the apartment. He’d known his dad since they were kids. Indy’s phone said it was one in the morning, so if things hadn’t changed, Uncle would be at the same intersection, working his shift from eight to four.

Indy left his luggage in his room and kept the lights on as he left the apartment. Something told him he should keep things the same.

As he walked to the halal cart, relief slowly replaced his anxiety. It was only his neighborhood that was dark; once he started walking to the intersection, the lights returned. People were still up and about, and the bodegas were running. It felt normal again, thank God.

When he reached the intersection, he eased, and let out a hopeful sigh. The halal cart was still there. And was that Uncle Syed? Have things changed or have they stayed the same?

<br>
Uncle Syed looked visibly older, like he had aged 20 years in the time between Indy’s high school graduation and now. When Indy was younger, he knew a man with rich black hair who laughed with the might of a beast. When Uncle Syed talked, you could feel the sound waves reverberate around you. Although his voice was deep, his stature tall, and his hair thick, he was the humblest man Indy had ever known.
Looking at him now, his beard had turned almost completely white, and he looked frail, even undernourished for someone who cooked for a living. He still had his resting smile, but it had decreased in intensity, settling for simplicity over delight. He had always been humble, but he truly looked the part now.

“Inzamam *beta*? Is that you?”

Indy was startled at Uncle Syed’s quick recognition. He thought he was different, but Uncle saw right through it.

“*A-Assalamualaikum*, Uncle Syed. Long time no see. Hope you have been well Inshallah.” Indy felt obligated to act cordial to compensate for Uncle Syed’s change in demeanor. After all these years, he found himself wanting to see his crooked teeth when he smiled, to hear his contagious laughter again.

“*Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullah*, Inzamam. It is good to see you, *Alhamdolillah*.” Uncle Syed cracked a smile of serenity, though his teeth weren’t visible yet. As Syed looked at Inzamam, he received a welcome dose of comfort and nostalgia. The boy’s features were just like his father’s. His brown eyes and sharp, thick eyebrows accentuated his confident demeanor, and his well sculpted beard made him look much older than he had remembered. Inzamam resembled his father now more than he resembled his own self from high school. He had really become a man, *Mashallah*. The only features that came from his mother were his fair almond brown skin and his round nose. Uncle Syed took a moment to reminisce; Inzamam’s parents were like his family, and he missed them already. He turned to Inzamam. “Have you just arrived?”

“Yes, Uncle. I am looking—”

“Would you like some food? Uncle still has the best lamb over rice in New York City.” Uncle Syed could see Inzamam’s restlessness. Did he not know?

“No thank you, Uncle. I am looking for my family. Do you know where they could be at this hour?”

Uncle Syed sighed and looked at Inzamam sympathetically.

“*Beta*," he said, "I have not seen them for months.”

“What? What do you mean? Are they on vacation?”

“*Ahista beta*.” Inzamam was visibly distraught, and Uncle Syed felt bad for him. What should he say? Syed was a compassionate man, but he believed in honesty. “Inzamam, they are gone. One day, they just disappeared, along with other people I knew.”

“They must have forgotten to tell you, Uncle. I’m sure they are visiting somewhere.”

“Inzamam beta, I have known your family for 30 years. Your father and my brother, *inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon*, were best friends in grade school. I have taken care of their children, you included, watered their plants, and checked that they came back safe after their trips. But one day, they left, and they told me nothing. I do not know where they went.” Uncle Syed wished he could get out of the cart and comfort him, since the boy looked even more confused now. “I am sorry I cannot help you, Inzamam. *Inshallah* they will be back soon.”

Indy didn’t know what to do. He looked at Uncle Syed, smiled sheepishly at him, and said thanks. At least the house was still open.

“Wait, beta. At least take some food. Have you eaten?”

Indy wasn’t in the mood to take favors, but he was starving. “Thank you Uncle.”

He took the lamb over rice plate from Uncle Syed, thanked him again, and walked across the street until he couldn’t see him. Once he reached a quiet corner, he sat on the pavement, Halal food in hand. Throughout Indy’s life, he’d been moving. When he was seven and his family left his father’s neighborhood to live with his uncle in Defence. When he was twelve and they crossed the sea for a better life. When he was eighteen and he fled to the other side of the country for college. For most of his life, Indy had been in a temporary state of leaving. But this time, for the first time, he felt he had no destination, no place to leave and no place to go back to. Indy placed his food on the sidewalk and held his head in his hands. He was lost.

### 2 | Lahore
It was sunny in Lahore when Zahra got married. The occasion was lengthy and eventful, but she remembered the birds and the food in particular with a clearness rivaling the unlittered sky that week. It was the middle of spring, and the birds flew as if they had somewhere to go. Zahra did not know what to call them, so she called them *Chiru*—all of them—like it was a family name they adopted as she adopted her own. They came and went through that week, maybe out of hunger, or curiosity, and Zahra took any opportunity to escape the reception to watch them fly with the smooth blue sky in the background. When they were resting or scavenging on the ground or table, she would bother them, and as they scattered, she would look up as if she were painting in her secondary school art class again. She never got tired of creating the same world every time, a world with a sky, some grass, clouds, and as many birds as she could draw, some distant and some so close she could touch, or even be, them. The simplicity of such a scene would calm younger Zahra as it calmed her then, amidst an especially confusing and complex time in her life.

And the food she remembered not for its quality, but for its outlandishness, its sheer audacity to be served in an otherwise gorgeous Pakistani wedding. But Zain wanted Italian food, and as the newly wed husband, he had his demands met. On the night of the Walima, they catered the local Pizza Hut, which, despite its indecency, turned out to be tasty, much to Zahra's frustration. Zain's favorite kind of pizza was tandoori chicken pan pizza with a seekh kabob stuffed into the crust. It was an abomination, and very far from Italian cuisine, or any cuisine for that matter, but by God was it delicious. Many of the guests complained about the pizza (they expected chicken jalfrezi, nihari, and lamb korma), but Zahra found herself laughing with her husband, remarking on how innovative the pizza was as well as how ugly it looked.

Zahra and Zain were arranged to marry. Their families were close from when their grandfathers did their O and A-levels together, and Zahra's mother and Zain's father were closer to each other than they were to their respective spouses, whom they were arranged to as well. Who was better to marry your child to than someone raised by your best friend?

Zahra and Zain didn't have much say in the decision — their parents were too invested in the idea and the couple was too inexperienced to be picky. Though Zain’s family was significantly richer than Zahra’s, and they lived on the outskirts of the city, the two families got together every so often such that the kids were at least cordial with each other. *Better than marrying a stranger like Farida did,* Zahra reminded herself during the wedding.

That didn't stop the marriage from frightening both of them, of course. They were fated to spend their lives with this person they barely knew, someone their parents trusted at least, but they were not afforded an opinion on it until well after the ceremony. Regardless, they learned each other because they had more important things to worry about. They had to raise a family.

<br>
The first thing Zain said when he began to dream of a future for their son was that the pizza in the U.S. was world renowned, and that a plethora of Italian immigrants settled in the States, especially in New York City, where his uncle lived.

"Imagine the food we could eat there!" he’d say. "Bari-mamu said there are pizza and pasta places open all night. And they are cheap. Cheap and tasty, like we have here, except without the diarrhea!"

At first, Zahra dismissed it as her goofy Zain having his head in the clouds again, but he never let the idea go.
“Imagine if we could tell our Dadas that we made it to America. How proud they would be of the both of us. And of our little Inzu beta as well.”

<br>
Zahra didn’t care for America. She was intent on spending the rest of her life in Pakistan. But over the years, the love she had for the men in her life overcame her own wishes. She began to dream of her son's future too, in the way that Zain did, and soon she entertained her husband's dreams as well as a few of her own.

By the time they had made it to America, Zahra had learned to put the needs of her family before her own. She hated New York City, but it didn't matter. She was convinced it was the right decision, so much so that she would lie and tell others she was happy with the move. She didn't say she longed to be back home, where the mangoes were juicy and the people were hospitable. She didn't say that in America, she was in a constant state of anxiety about her behavior — how when she talked to people, she could never tell if she chose the right words, laughed the right way, or moved her noodle arms appropriately. She simply said that New York City was incredible, that it was stunning (quite literally), and that she missed all the people back home.

Zahra was a grateful person. When she spent time with her family, she reminded herself they could leave this Earth at any time. When she prayed, she told herself it could be her last prayer on Earth. And when she walked around Lahore, the city she loved as if it were her companion, her best friend, she told herself there may come a day where she would leave it or even never see it again.

But despite her preparations, she consumed herself with nostalgia and longing once she moved. After all, it was not just Lahore she came to miss, but herself. Zahra had lived in one place her whole life. It was in her small home on the outskirts of Defence where she learned to talk and talk back to her elder brother. It was in her dirty junior school down the road where she learned to make friends (and a few enemies), and her more chaotic middle school where she learned how to present herself to boys and rival girls as well. In the masjid, she learned to pray and read Quran – something she did every day and then twice a day in New York. And in high school, she learned to dream, not just in Urdu but in English as well, reading poetry and literature from any book she could borrow from poorly stocked libraries or her teacher's homes.

But all of these places were well within the same place, even within walking distance, and though her life was rich, it wasn't complicated; though she had many facets of her identity nurtured in different spaces, they never overlapped or competed. Zahra had the blessing of having a consistent self, one that led to peace, confidence, even a little naivety in the face of whatever came her way. Since she never left her hometown, she made the mistake of believing this self was agnostic to space and place, that it was independent and sufficient, as she never knew a reality in which it wasn't.

In the States, people remarked at how humble she and her husband were. Her son’s friends, her American acquaintances, and her American-born cousins called her quiet, gentle, and even acquiescent. But they did not know. They never saw her light up when calling her best friend in Lahore or chortle at her husband’s jokes at home. They didn’t see her in her passion and fury, in her tears and her conviction. Did this mean she was quiet now? Was that who she was? Her old, colorful self became an exception, and she began to live between these exceptions, waiting for the next time she could feel herself again. But they came so rarely, in phone calls, books, or late night talks with her husband (when he wasn’t so tired from work) that she couldn’t even say it was herself anymore. But this was her reality now, and she knew it was for the best.

In lieu of her own atrophy, Zahra grew increasingly invested in her son's growth. While she became quieter and more introspective, she witnessed her 12-year-old son become confident and vocal, to her and her husband in particular. Although it was exhausting to handle a rising teenager, she was also proud of his developing disposition. That he became confident speaking—in accordance or dissent—to his parents, teachers, and peers meant the world to her. Inzamam was not a confident boy growing up in Pakistan. Stubborn, yes, but anxiously so. In America, she hoped he could find himself. America was the land of dreams and opportunity, not for her, or her husband, but for her children and their children's children. If there was a place to transform her son, it was America with its chaos, magic, and competition. Transform it could, and transform it did.

<br>
And so, after those formative years in New York City, from Inzamam's seventh grade to roughly his 10th, Zahra became sure America was the right place for her family. Her investment in her son turned into excitement when talking about the family's future with Zain one winter night. Inzamam had just gotten back from a junior varsity basketball game where he scored a go-ahead shot in the last minute. He came home ecstatic and exhausted and promptly fell asleep after eating a few spoonfuls of biryani.

"I want to raise a kid in America," she told her husband as they sat on their purple bed sheets in their still, dim lamp lights. "Another kid, from birth, in this country of magic."

Zain was on board. He had come to love his wife and respect her judgment. She was growing older, and her eyes didn't twinkle as much as they used to when they first got married, but when they did, it reminded him how much he cared for her and wished for her happiness. This time, her eyes twinkled again, and they twinkled loudly, like a lighthouse calling ships to shore or a car's high beams illuminating its surroundings in the deep, cold night.

The next summer, when Inzamam was a rising junior, he had a younger sister. Her eyes twinkled like Zahra’s did and her eyebrows scowled like Zain's. Her skin was darker than her brother's, but she shone so bright when she was born that they had to name her Sana. The couple found the pun amusing (Zain more so than Zahra), and even she seemed to squint at the light she emanated. Her giggles were musical, like Qawwali, and her smile was intense and unmatched, like the glare of the sun. When she cried, she trilled gently, her lips vibrating against each other while she whimpered. She was easy to love, and her parents loved her, truly, from the start.

Everyone said she was a beautiful baby, then a beautiful child, and she brought her parents a happiness they had not felt since they moved to New York. But despite her importance to her parents, in the years following her birth, she never came to know her elder brother. She would come to hold only a faint recollection of him from the summer he came back from his first year of college. And when he would come to mind, she’d feel a certain roughness, like he was sandpaper in her mind, but she wouldn’t be able to recall why, or anything else. Indy himself never paid attention to her. To him, Sana was an extension of his parents, a dependent, someone who came with the package. He was cordial to her in his high school years and in that tumultuous summer after, but he was not much else. Indy didn’t tell anyone about the extent of his escapism, the lengths he went to avoid responsibility. His friends never knew—Sam barely did—and it was one of many things he kept secret. He was an acquaintance to his own family.
