So, I've been feeling a bit lonely/anxious this weekend, so I figured it'd be the perfect time to give an update as to how Jordan is going. Fair warning, since I tend to reflect pretty hard, this may sound pretty negative. Also, a lot of my reflections come from time alone, but it's important to keep in mind that I've been trying to explore, at least every few days or every week. Overall, I've been doing well (or at least better), so don't worry.

Also, as usual, feel free to skip down to "Summary, Conclusions, and Looking Forward" if you want a more concise summary of my time here.

## My Second Week

My last blog post covered my first week, so I'll start with week 2, which was actually pretty bad for me. This was when my classes started, which surprised me with their rigor and intimidation. If you don't know, I'm taking 4 classes here, all taught exclusively in Arabic. Those classes are Standard Arabic, Jordanian Colloquial Arabic, Media Arabic, and Translation (mostly Arabic texts to English).

I was kind of upset because in orientation week, the program directors told us they won't give us too much homework so that we would have more of a chance to explore and do our learning "out there". But, as it turns out, we actually got a pretty sizeable load of homework. I had classes every day, so I'd have homework due, well, every day.

This really put me off, because my homesickness and anxiety from my first week was still there, and I was still trying to deal with it. And so it was hard making time for studies when I generally just felt crappy about everything. And so I'd try to get my homework done as soon as possible to get some time alone.. But then when alone I'd just feel lonely, sad, and helpless again. I ended up listening to a lot of emo music these beginning few weeks just to let myself wallow a bit in my emotions, and for catharsis, especially when travelling or exploring. Not My Chemical Romance kind of emo, but more either spoken-wordy midwest emo (like empire! empire! i was a lonely estate), or (more recently) post-hardcorey kind of screamo. Anyway, that's not important.

#### <sup>I still did a decent amount of exploring this week. Here's a picture of a random abandoned theme park I found when walking around Abdoun with Danny and Kevin. Like, seriously, a real abandoned theme park. Was really cool.</sup>

<br>
The good thing about not really knowing what to do with my free time was that I slept really early because I didn't want to do anything else. And homework forced me to keep at least a bit busy (instead of feeling super restless for the whole day, like I did in orientation week). Also, I started an in-my-room workout routine which helped me deal with my restlessness. Good habits!

## My Third Week

So, my third week was a break (thank God). It was Eid (Islamic holiday) that week, and so all of our school was off. It was kind of awkward having just one week of classes then being on break, but hey, I'm not complaining. I originally was planning on going to Palestine or something, but I scratched that because I kind of just wanted to stay in Amman, explore the city a little, and get some uninterrupted time to myself.

This turned out to be a good decision, surprisingly. Somehow, I started feeling more comfortable being alone. I went out every other day or so, just exploring a little, but I didn't really push myself, and I spent most of my time inside. I watched some movies/shows, played some video games, and wrote a little. Oh, and I started a game of Civilization 5 in the second half of the break, which I got super addicted/attached to. I played like 15 hours of it in two days, and accidentally stayed up to 6am playing it one night.

But these activities actually helped calm my anxiety a little, because I started redeveloping things to do when I was alone (instead of just feeling crappy). I also had more time to Skype friends and family, which I did a lot. And so I stopped feeling helpless when alone and started to value it. To be honest, looking back, I'm not sure how that mindset change happened. I could have very easily gotten more anxious, especially since I had so much time and no idea what to do with it. And to be honest, I'm not really sure how exactly I spent those days. I even stopped working out of laziness.

![Ajloun-Trail](/resources/images/10-02-2016/ajloun.JPG)

#### <sup>I took a day trip to Ajloun (another region in Jordan) during this break with Hans (pictured). We went on a hiking trail and it was actually pretty nice. Though I don't always have the energy to explore or go out, when I do, it at least tends to get my mind off of things, and relieve some of my anxiety.</sup>

<br>
To be fair, as you can see above, I explored a bit. Went to Paris Circle in Amman, Wadi Mujib, and Ajloun, but that was still less than half of the break (and honestly all I really had energy for at the time).

However, I think this was when I started using Facebook a lot more. Originally, I wanted to disconnect from social media, but especially during the break, where I was alone a lot, it gave me more of a feeling of community and friendship. I enjoyed talking to my friends and family and commenting on random stupid things. It made me feel, to some extent, like I was at home. I still have social media uninstalled from my phone, so when I go out, I can disconnect and be alone, but when at home (when recharging or relaxing), I started really appreciating the value of Facebook to give me something/someone(s) to go back to, which I haven't really had here.

I also made an Excel spreadsheet that calculated the percentage of my trip here that I was done with, which helped with my homesickness a bit. I was surprised to see at that time that I was 20% done already, which actually went a long way to motivating me that things are developing and time is passing, and soon I'll get to see my friends and family again. :)

## My Fourth Week

I was kinda scared going into my fourth week because school was starting again, and just when I was starting to feel comfortable getting time to myself. But, though at first it was tiring, I started to get kind of used to it. And though the homework was a bit annoying, it also gave me a nice excuse to be home in the evenings. And it wasn't nearly as bad as Duke, so I'd generally finish by 6 or 7pm and get evenings to myself, which I started really enjoying.

This week was also when I started my volunteering. I joined this center for Iraqi refugees (coordinated by an Iraqi refugee himself) under an organization called CRP, and I started teaching English to some of the adult refugees there. Part of the reason I joined was to potentially get to know some of them, and maybe even do a documentary with them, but I quickly learned that wasn't going to happen.

See, though the first class went well, I realized it wasn't exactly what I imagined. The class was around 15-20 people long (instead of me tutoring people one-on-one), and I had a very explicit role as a teacher, so I realized it would be very inappropriate for me to hang out with them more personally. Not to mention, they were also generally much older than me, and the majority were female.

#### <sup>Here's a picture of food to keep you interested while you listen to me over analyze my life. This was actually the only picture I have in my album that's from the fourth week (which shows how "normal"/school-focused it was). My host mom here is nice, but she only really cooks every couple of days (so the default is leftovers or make-your-own-sandwich). But when she does cook, especially Jordanian food, it's really good.</sup>

<br>
So, after the first teaching English class, I felt kind of awkward. One, I realized I wouldn't get one-on-one time, which is generally the type of teaching/tutoring I prefer. And more importantly, I just didn't feel comfortable being in a position of power or authority over them, especially because I had no experience, particular passion, or credibility for being an English teacher. I just felt like I had no business being there, and them being older and mostly women made it more awkward for me.

Anyway, after the first week, we (the team of teachers from my program) ended up talking about planning, and I volunteered to do more curriculum planning rather than teaching (since we already 2-3 teachers for the class anyway). I felt more comfortable doing logistics and planning, especially since I'm good at finding resources online, and though I won't be able to get to know the refugees as I originally intended, I think it was the right decision for me and for my approach to this NGO, though it is a bit more work.

## My Fifth Week

My fifth week was when I started to really get my routine down. I would wake up at 7:45, get ready and eat breakfast, and leave by 8:25 to get to my 9am class on time. After two classes, I'd do homework during my 2 hour lunch break, have my class, then finish up any remaining homework after school. This normally meant I could finish my homework by 5pm, which was when traffic started clearing up, and so I'd take the bus home then and be home by 6:30. I then had the evening to chill, watch a movie, or work out (which I did 3 times a week).

This made me feel better, because I started feeling more familiar with how my days were. And I got comfortable with the places around campus, had a place to study, a McDonalds to get ice cream at when I wanted to treat myself, and an established bus route. That and having evenings at home gave me a certain mode of living, which was nice. And then I'd either relax or travel on the 3-day weekends.

That weekend, I went on a trip with our program to Feynan, which is an ecolodge near some mountains in seemingly the middle of nowhere. I wasn't expecting much, just another trip with my program, but I ended up really enjoying it.

![Middlebury-Feynan-Picture](/resources/images/10-09-2016/grouppic.JPG)

#### <sup>I took a LOT of landscape pictures on this trip, some of which came out really nice. But this was a cute picture, and one of the few ones that had people in them. Check out my Facebook album (and scroll to the end) to see more landscapes. (As you can tell, I prefer taking landscape pictures to people pictures. Even animals are okay. Just not super comfortable taking pictures of people lol, though people honestly make pictures more interesting to others.)</sup>

I think it was a combination of things. One, we spent a lot of time in transport. And I love transportation, especially in buses where you can be more alone (but "around" people). And so though there were friends around me, I got to listen to music, look out the window, and think, while still feeling like I was going somewhere and not sitting in my room alone (as I am now :p). Two, the original hike was really long (10 miles / 7 hours), but it was beautiful, and paced, so I got some time to reflect by myself, and talk to my friends occasionally. Three, I brought my camera, which actually really helped. I can get anxious when I don't have something to do or think about, and having a camera allowed me to be mindful and reflect, while still having something to keep the "do-things" part of my brain occupied. And four, I got to talk more casually and closely with some of the people in my program. Though I spent a lot of time in the trip silent, just being with other people was nice sometimes, and I had a couple of pretty great conversations naturally as well. Honestly, most of it was the social atmosphere. I got to be with people, but still be quiet and be alone most of the time, while talking every so often. That's my favorite type of social environment.

Anyway, after that hike, a night stargazing, and a morning sunrise-gazing, we took a bus to the Dead Sea and spent that afternoon swimming and relaxing. The Dead Sea itself was way less pleasant than I imagined. It was cool being able to float, but since it was so salty, it hurt this cut I had on my arm, and if you ever got some of it near your eyes, it'd burn really bad. So "swimming in the Dead Sea" was nice to knock off my bucket list, but I don't think I'll do it again. :P

#### <sup>Ok, I had to. Here's a landscape picture I took during the trip. This was at night when we were stargazing and stuff from the ecolodge.</sup>

Overall, the trip was really nice, and it got me optimistic. It wasn't just because of the trip, but during this time I started to feel more comfortable socially with the people in my program, which was nice. Gave me some sort of contentment.

## My Sixth Week

Lastly, we have this past week, which was my sixth. I can proudly say it's been kind of uneventful, mostly just school. However, it has been a bit boring and restless. Now that I have a routine established, I have a slight itch to do something "different" or more stimulating to keep me going. I'm hoping to find a topic for a documentary soon, which I would really like to start. I talked to someone on the trip last week about it, and she said she'd be interested in helping me pursue it, which would be great.

But either way, I'm okay with being bored as long as I'm not sad or too anxious, since I can keep myself busy. I watched Princess Mononoke on Tuesday evening, which was actually better than I remember. I love how it's a Studio Ghibli movie, but also really mature, deep, and somewhat sad.

I also went to a play on Thursday night, which was super artsy. <a href="https://web.facebook.com/events/743648782440908/">Here</a> is the link to the event, if you want to see. It was a (fictional I believe) story centered around Ibn Battuta, and was mostly a couple of mini-stories, each in a different country he visited. It was good and very artsy, but I barely understood anything. I got some sentences here and there, but I couldn't catch onto any of the overarching themes, nuances, or any of the "deep" soliloquies.

It made me think, though I'd love to get more into the art scene here, that my Arabic isn't near good enough to understand expression here, not to mention cultural distance, me being an American kid. As Yixin said about how he felt in China, when I was Skyping him, "I feel like a kid here". I can understand some stuff, but anything other than generic, surface-level conversation and I get lost. But the performance was still great, it's just I might stick more to Arabic movies, because those have more action and visuals, so I can catch onto the plot easier.

#### <sup>A quick phone picture of the play. It was pretty artsy, which I loved, I just wish I could understand it more!! All the nuances, artsy language, etc, was lost on me :(</sup>

And now, at the end of week 6, I'm in my room alone, as usual (no complaints here). I did a lot of homework yesterday and finished the lesson plan for the Iraqi Refugee English Class, and I'm probably going to finish this post up, eat, then try and upload pictures from the trip (I took some beautiful pictures, ngl), and maybe watch a movie if I get time. I was feeling lonely this past day or two, but I think it's just withdrawal symptoms because my last week and a half have been around people.

However, I am a bit suspicious - I feel similar to week one, where I'd have a few hours of free time and feel really restless. I wouldn't feel like doing anything, even the stuff I enjoy that stimulates me (like movies, games, or music). So it leaves me confused and unsatisfied, because I need good, inner-stimulating quality alone time in my evenings to keep me going. And so I'm a bit scared that my anxiety that I felt in week one is coming back, but it's not my first (or last time) dealing with anxiety, so hopefully it'll pass anyway.

But now that I got the chance to write and get some of my thoughts out, I feel much better, not as lonely, and less bottled up/anxious. God, writing has helped so much during my time here. I really like that I'm building this habit, too.

## Summary, Conclusions, and Looking Forward

So, just to summarize, in case you (understandably) didn't want to read all that up above:

* My second week was pretty crappy because I had to deal with the first week of classes, along with my anxiety and loneliness that still hadn't gone away yet. But I got through it.

* Third week was thankfully a break. In addition to exploring a little, I got to spend a lot of time alone at home, which ended up going well since I managed to get more comfortable being alone. Though I still had social media uninstalled from my phone, I started using Facebook on my computer in the evenings more to talk to friends/family and just waste time/relax, because it made me feel like I had something/someone(s) to go back to, and made me feel more connected to home.

* Fourth week was when I started to get more comfortable with school. I also started teaching Iraqi refugees English, but after the first class, I decided to do more curriculum/logistics work than teaching. I realized I wouldn't get any one-on-one time, and I just didn't feel comfortable or qualified to teach them (or have authority over them), especially since they were much older than me and many were female.

* Fifth week was kinda nice, because that's when I really solidified a routine. I also went on a 2-day trip to Feynan on the weekend, which ended up being awesome! I got time to reflect by myself, got to take some awesome pictures and keep myself busy being a ~photographer~, as well as just be with people and have some good conversations.

* Sixth week (this past week) was pretty regular, but a bit hollow. I'm hoping to find a good topic for a documentary soon, something that's interesting but also informative (and not just another refugee documentary you don't actually learn anything from). Having a project would keep me busy and give me some stimulation in addition to my now established routine. I also went to a play on Thursday night, which was great, but I couldn't understand much of the themes or deeper conversations, so I was left thinking it'd be hard for me to navigate the arts/expression scene here. I feel like a little kid, in that I'm pretty comfortable with surface-level conversation, but if it ever goes deeper I just stop being able to communicate well. Some of my anxiety has made its way back these past few days, but writing it out reminds me this isn't the first time I've gotten anxiety, and hopefully it'll pass again with time. But I do feel a bit restless, and slightly stagnant.

#### <sup>A cute cat picture I took after watching the sunrise at the Feynan ecolodge. God, I really liked taking pictures on that trip lol.</sup>

Overall, things are generally getting better, especially if you compare now to my first two weeks here. I'm 40% done with my trip now, which is kinda crazy to think about, but also makes me excited to be back (I know, it's early to think that, but let me be). I've established a good routine here, and I feel way less anxious now. I still feel lonely sometimes but it's the type of lonely I feel everywhere, even at Duke, so I can accept that.

I've been wanting to find a good topic for a documentary for a while, but it's hard to do that if I only have a few months here. I'd want to do a story that people aren't aware of, so that it's specific and informative, but intriguing. But, again, that may be tough to find especially since my Arabic is pretty basic and conversational. Regardless, it'd be great to find that, because it may go a long way to making my semester here feel more meaningful.

Oh, and I ironically didn't even mention my Arabic development. My Arabic is getting much better, and I feel way more comfortable with it, but I feel like I'm reaching a plateau. I can communicate fairly decently in daily life now, but I'm still really bad at understanding anything deeper or expressing ideas or inclinations in a comfortable way. I don't think I can expect to get that after only a few months here, since those conversations/use cases are rare, but I don't know what to focus on now with my Arabic.

I think, looking forward, I'll just continue to work on classes, especially since midterms are in a weekish. And then travelling a bit during midterm break, hopefully I can get into a project or initiative that could occupy my time for the last month-ish of the program. And I hope my anxiety leaves, so I can enjoy my free/recharge time again. All in all, things are looking up! I am still really looking forward to being back, but I've gotten used to my lifestyle here at least, and besides occasional loneliness and anxiety, things are getting better. Let's hope the last 60% of the trip is fun, worthwhile, and meaningful for me.
