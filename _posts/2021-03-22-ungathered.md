ungathered

in truth

a ghost

and its

seams

to come apart

when it falls

<br>
don't forget

the keys to

your favorite

automobile

<br>
vestigial

it is

when the

heart leaves the brain

<br>
ungathered

in truth

aghast

my eyes are

yellow-red, don't let

him

close the door

i need to

leave me alone

<br>
it's gone now

it's gone

my little

bear

unseen

alone

and left behind

<br>
you left me to die
