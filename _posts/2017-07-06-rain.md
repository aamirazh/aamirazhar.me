rain falls

outside my window

those drops

of clear water

released from the heavens

they freefall

for miles

only to disappear

into the ground

<br>
i confess,

are we not rain?

freefalling

through this world

left alone, and

governed by forces

we cannot touch

<br>
are we not helpless

to the grand structures

that subdue us?

tiny ants,

soft spirits

in the shadows of titans

we fight for our lives

yet only bruise our fists

whisper,

are we not insignificant

to the divine?

<br>
and at the end,

do we not

just disappear?

we all seek to fade into ash

retreat in the soil

and revert to our nothing

recite,

we are but made of dust

so should we not

return to it?

<br>
so,

i attest:

are we not rain?

<br>
do we not fall?

<br>
<br>
..will we not perish?
