Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar squirms. Outside, the world is quiet. The cocoon is hard. The caterpillar is hungry. It knows it must leave soon.

The other caterpillars have become butterflies. They waited at first, but the winds and rains pushed them along, and they have since become occupied and moved on. Every so often, they think of the caterpillar, fleetingly—for he is now just a memory.

Each time they remember, the caterpillar stirs. The memory is not lodged in the past—it is constructed in the present. They remember, they wonder, and the caterpillar starts to crack its cocoon.

The butterflies are long gone. They will never see the caterpillar again. But they remember. And the caterpillar breaks out.

Memory itself is longing. The caterpillar is now a butterfly. The winds take it from the trees to the rivers and the skies. As it flies, it remembers too.
