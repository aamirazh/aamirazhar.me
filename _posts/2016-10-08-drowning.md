*This piece is designed to be read aloud. I still need to test it further, since this is my first completed spoken word piece, but I figured I may as well publish it for now.*

--

do you ever feel like you're drowning?

like your hands are thrashing, looking for something to hold onto

but there just is nothing there

like your lungs are contracting, trying to breathe in air

but all it can find is heavy, ice cold liquid

like your brain is so confused, asking, demanding:

"why the hell can't i breathe right now?"

<br>
do you ever feel that way?

<br>
and as you look around, everyone seems to be so perfect

like you're a fish, and the world is a sea

and you can't seem to find the current

so you're stuck --

in still waters: waiting, lingering, watching

watching the rest of the world swim so easily

how do they do it?

<br>
and you know what sucks --

is how lonely it feels

<br>
i tell myself failure is best experienced alone

because at least you don't disappoint anyone else

but i realize -- the worst person to disappoint is yourself

<br>
because then you begin lose your trust

and you just want to leave it all behind

you're done dealing with such a miserable person

you want to delete their number

block them on social media

hit the gym and never see them again

tell your friends they were a mistake and that you're over them

<br>
but then you realize:

you realize, that person is you

and you're stuck with them for the rest of your life

stuck with this.. failure

and it's no one's fault but yourself

<br>
but then somehow.. we keep fighting

<br>
i remember hearing a story on TV as a kid

of that guy who was hiking alone in southeast utah

he slipped into a narrow canyon with an eight hundred pound boulder stuck on his arm

and after one hundred twenty seven hours he decided to break his bone and amputate his arm with a small, dull pocketknife

and then walk down to the end of the canyon

and rappel a sixty five foot sheer cliff face to safety; with ONE ARM

<br>
i remember my 9 year old self just thinking, like

"why?"

why not just die there?

what kind of grit does it take to do that?

why did he not just give up?

<br>
but i realize now,

though us humans suck at a lot of things,

one thing we're damn talented at

is being so dangerously stubborn

even when everything is working against us

<br>
..you know, i really like to swim

i like to dive deep down and swim on the floor; it's so peaceful

it reminds me that it's okay to be underwater sometimes

it's okay to not be able to breathe

it's okay to feel lonely, or hopeless, or powerless

no matter what, though, we always manage to find the surface

<br>
it reminds me that what kills us when we drown is our reaction, not the water

so it tells me: don't panic

keep fighting, but do it confidently

you will find air

you deserve this

you deserve to be here

you deserve to exist

and never let anyone tell you differently

<br>
society tries so hard to drown us

if you don't believe me, just listen for it

it envelopes us with undertows

telling us:

you're too angry

you're too fat

you're too quiet

you're too foreign

you're too black

you're too queer

you're too honest

you're too real.

<br>
but you're not.

they're wrong; they're fucking wrong, i swear

<br>
there's a lot of water around us

it's cold, angry, forceful, and heavy

but there is a surface; i promise you

<br>
so please don't drown

don't give them that satisfaction

remember to take care of yourself

you are worth it.
