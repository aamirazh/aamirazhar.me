A bell sits deep in the bedside drawer of Indy’s room. Its silver hull reminded him of South Indian stainless steel cups and plates. Its soft ring reminded him of his mother. When Indy was in his third or fourth grade, he would miss his mother and ask his teacher to call her so he could hear her voice, and his mother would pick him up, reluctantly, telling him he couldn't do this every week. One day, she bought this bell and told him, *whenever you miss amma, ring this bell, put it close to your ear, and you will feel me there with you. No one else will hear it, only you, only you and me, my jaan, and then you do not need to call me because you know I am right there beside you.*

The bell is tiny, the size of his finger, and it sits lodged between band-aids and lotion, under some business cards so it can’t be seen. Indy had touched it once, three years ago, before leaving home for college, and he had not touched it since—he forgot about it, or so he told himself, as he did his mother, his father, and his sister as well.

Indy left this room, he created himself again, a self with new skin that had shed the old and with new eyes that saw the world anew. But under his rough, almond skin, beneath his long face, and below his long neck and slouched shoulders, there remained what was left of a boy—a boy who had loved his parents, a boy who had fallen in and out of love, a boy searching for something more and more and had never stopped looking. But Indy kept that boy hidden, he hid him somewhere in his room, in a chest somewhere, in his chest, deep in his heart, so that no one could find it but him. He kept this vulnerable self under lock and key and accessed him so rarely that he messed up the combination sometimes—he even hoped the day would come where he would forget it entirely and the boy would be gone and only his skeleton would be left.

When Indy finds out his family is missing, he feels the boy in his heart let go. There is a confusion, then a mourning, then some semblance of freedom—he feels that what had once been a part of him is no longer holding onto him, and he is unsure what to do with the space that was left. He enters a place that is familiar to him, but empty—like deja-vu or some kind of dream when he enters the house and sees everything in place but the people: lights on and a piece of paper left on the dining table.

<br>
“Hey babe!” Indy focuses his eyes on the screen talking to him. “How’s home?”

*How’s home,* he thinks. *Home.* The walls are light blue and his bed squeaks; the memory foam adjusts to accommodate his figure. He is not sure where to begin.

“I’m sorry, Sam, I’m kind of tired right now. Can I call you back tomorrow?”

“Are you in your room right now? Lemme see!”

Indy groans. He turns his phone around 360 degrees, landing it back on his face. “Sam, I’ll catch you up tomorrow. I really need some sleep.”

“Okay. You look tired. I forgot you’re three hours ahead. Hehe.” Sam smiles and perks her face up, a sign Indy takes as her missing him. Indy sees a flick of an eyebrow and hears a smooching noise from his phone; he blinks and finds himself back in Palo Alto. He sees her getting up from her light brown linen couch, looking at her phone, then looking at him. She sits right beside him—her blue eyes make him feel safe—mouths the words “I love you” and then plops down on her bed. He sees her ask him a question, something he can’t understand, and as she asks it, he witnesses her accented eyebrows raise, relax, and give way to soft and rounded eyes. Sam’s face is distinct—her nose is sharp and thin, her jawline almost right-angled—but when she talks to people, she finds a way to soften her own features, and others ease around her. Sam has a way about her, where she looks and acts so innocent that Indy can’t help but lean into her conversation, not out of pity, but out of desire—he finds himself wanting to satisfy her, to see her tentative expression turn into realization, then fulfillment, then even ecstasy as she completes the picture she is drawing in her head. She pulls a book from thin air—Katherine Boo's *Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity*—then pulls her hair away from her eyes like she is stripping away her curtains, Indy watching her as the scene fades away.

“I love you too,” Indy mouths, but it’s too late. The call drops and he is left alone in his room. He is alone in the apartment he used to call home.

He knows something is wrong. From the moment Indy stepped foot in LaGuardia—from the moment the plane took off from California—he was able to tell. Indy opens WhatsApp and clicks on his mother’s name.

<br>
*hey mom*

*i just got to LGA*

*gonna take the q70 home*

*or like to the apartment*

The message is still not seen or delivered. He scrolls up, and he sees messages, forwarded images, missed calls from the past three years. A long message catches his eye. It’s from last year, though he doesn’t remember reading it.

<br>
*Assalamualaikum my dear Inzamam jaan, I hope you are well. I know you are saying not to talk, and you maybe are not checking this message, but I am thinking of you today and want to tell you Zain and I are very proud of you. We know you are doing great things at Stanford and we look forward to when you can come home. We are waiting for you.*

*May Allah bestow his blessings on you and grant you health, wealth, and success Insha Allah. It has been two years since we have seen you. Please do not forget us. Do not forget Allah either. We love you.*

*—Ammi*

<br>
Indy yawns and turns off his phone. He thinks of the empty apartment, still furnished, lights still on, nothing out of place but a piece of paper on the table with a phone number on it. *I’ll call again in the morning.* Indy sighs and calms himself. *It’s nothing, just wait a night and everything will be okay.*

<br>
That night, he dreams of cool, running water coming into his bedroom, inching higher and wider until his bed floats up to the ceiling and his walls begin to wither away. His mother walks in and he shouts—he tells her to run away—but he is underwater and she can’t hear him. He shouts again, and he realizes he can’t see his body. His mother walks through the water towards him, she squints at him, she opens her mouth, and the dream ends.

### 2
The sky in Lahore was clear and sunny the week Zahra got married. The shaadi was long and filled with festivities, but she would remember the birds more than anything else, the way they flew and scattered as if they had somewhere to go. On the third day, Zahra decided to name them, so she called them *Chiru*—all of them—like it was a family name they adopted as she adopted her own. They came and went that week, maybe out of hunger or curiosity, and Zahra took any opportunity to sneak out and watch them fly with the smooth blue sky in the background. They would be resting or scavenging on the ground or snacks table, she would bother them, and as they scattered, Zahra would look up and paint them in her mind—grey birds and the clear sky behind them. She imagined a cloud or two, and a tall tree looming over her, and she imagined she was back in secondary school, drawing the same landscape over and over again.

Zahra would remember the food too, not for its quality, but for its outlandishness, its audacity to be served in a gorgeous Pakistani wedding. Zain had wanted Italian food—he loved Italian food and its culture—and he was the groom, so his demands were met. On the night of the walima, they catered their local Pizza Hut, which despite its indecency, quickly became one of Zahra's favorites. Zain’s go-to pizza order was a tandoori chicken pan pizza with a seekh kabob stuffed into the crust. It was an abomination—there was no argument there—but by God, was it delicious. Zahra remembered eating the crust, thinking of her husband, and wondering if this was what it was like to be married—to share in things both intimate and absurd, to learn and experience together, experience things twice and thrice but completely anew with someone by your side. Zahra became nervous that day as she sat next to her soon-to-be husband, a man she knew but did not know enough. She tried to imagine their future and could not conceive of what they would become. But as the night went on. The uncles complained to them about the pizza, expecting chicken jalfrezi, nahari and lamb korma. All Zahra could do was giggle with her husband, remarking on how innovative the pizza was as well as how ugly it looked.

<br>
Six years earlier, when Zahra was sixteen, her mother told her about Zain. She would remember that day, the way the warmth smothered her like a blanket, making her sleepy and sedentary like a lover pulling her back to him whenever she tried to get up. Uncle Ravi and his children were out for the day and Aisha was told not to use the AC unless it felt like it was over forty degrees. Zahra could do nothing but sit in the living room and read that whole day. She loved those quiet, hot weekend days.

“Good morning, beta.” Zahra jumped at the sound, and she closed the book when her mother walked closer like she had something to hide. “You are studying for your O-levels already? Mashallah.”

“No, ammi, I’m just reading this book.” She looked up at her mother, who was smiling her broken smile—her teeth were crooked and she had what looked like a lazy eye—and Zahra smiled back out of respect or love or perhaps expectation.

“What is it?”

“It’s nothing,” Zahra said. “Just a book Uncle Ravi gave to me to read.”

“Uncle Ravi is a good man. I cannot think where we would be without his generosity.” She sat down next to her daughter and placed a hand on her back. “You must help me clean their bedroom before they come back.”

Zahra nodded and motioned to get up, but her mother’s hand moved to her shoulder and nudged her back down. “Wait, Zahra. I need to talk to you about something.”

Zahra breathed in slowly and looked at her mother.

“Listen to me. I know I have not been the best to you and I have not made the best decisions in raising you.”

“Ammi, please, you don’t need to—”

“No, I know, I know I tell this to you all the time, about Muhammad and his death and how late I had you—anyway, I don’t wish to talk about the past. I want to talk to you about the future.”

Zahra adjusted herself and her mother’s hand slid down her back. Aisha gathered her hands in her lap. Zahra rested her hands under her legs and turned to face her mother.

“You are growing quickly, Mashallah. You are very beautiful, you know. Neither of your parents were wanted very much. You must know that you should get married as soon as you finish university, or even right after your A-levels if you wish.”

“Amma, I don’t want to get married.”

“I know, Zahra, I thought that when I was your age as well. In fact, I thought it so long until it was too late for me to find a good husband. You will change your mind soon. It is just because you are still young now that you don’t know how the world works.”

“Amma, I don’t want to get married.” Zahra pouted and took the Harry Potter book from beside her and put it on her lap.

“Listen. I have a very good friend, someone I am blessed to know. His name is Uthman.”

“I know who Uthman mamu is. You talk about him all the time.”

“Listen, Zahra. You know his son, Zain, yes beta?”

“Yes. I saw him at Bari Mamu’s walima and you introduced me to him.”

“Look, Zahra…” A shadow fell on her daughter’s face. “I think you should marry Zain.”

“I don’t like him.”

“You don’t know him, jaan.” Aisha sat up. “Please listen to me. They are a good family, Uthman is an amazing, thoughtful and intelligent man, and I am sure his son is the same.”

“I don’t want to get married, ammi.”

“Zahra, just give him a chance, please. Look, I have told Uthman that we are coming over for chai next weekend. Just come and talk to him, and then we can talk more about it, okay?”

“Why do I have to go if I already told you I don’t want to?”

“Zahra.” Aisha’s face became hard and she gave Zahra a look that made her feel that there were some things she would never know. Her wrinkles showed, she looked older and self-assured, she was pulling her words and feelings from places Zahra couldn’t see. “We need this, Zahra. This isn’t about you. This is about our family and the family you will build and the generations that will come after you. I know you cannot see past yourself now. But when you get older, you will. Zain’s family has resources, they will be able to pay for your children’s schooling, you will have a house to raise a family in, you can read and draw all you want because you will have maids to help you with the house. Or, if you two decide, you can raise your child in America. You will have the freedom to choose.

“And do you think Uncle Ravi would pay for your children’s schooling too? No. If you truly want it, you can stay in this house. Uncle Ravi likes you and you are a responsible young woman. But you will live your life like me, having nothing to your name besides a room that is rented to you, being nice to men who are not good to you, cooking food for someone else’s children before you can cook for your own.”

Aisha got up, indicating the conversation was coming to an end. The sun started to peek through the window and Zahra squinted while she watched her mother move.

“Uthman and I have a special connection. Most people of that status would never dream of marrying such a poor family into theirs. This is our only way out, Zahra.” She stood at the end of the living room before the kitchen. “It’s your only way out.”

Indy feels a pressure on his chest when he wakes up, like something had been sitting on him the whole night only to evaporate when he opens his eyes. He takes deep breaths in and out until he feels normal again. He takes his phone from his bedside table and checks the time. He scrolls through Instagram until he forgets the dreams he had that night.

Sam posted a story a few hours earlier—five in the morning, two in Palo Alto—about an earthquake in Indonesia that had left thousands without homes and multiple dead or missing. She reposted a series of calls to action, then a blank template at the end with white text saying *PLEASE DONATE TO SAVE LIVES AND HELP THOSE LESS FORTUNATE* with blue highlight scribbled behind it. *link is in bio!!* Indy replies to the last story with a heart and then gets out of bed. He had not touched the bed for three years, but it felt like it welcomed him, like it had been waiting with his imprint for the three years he was gone.

Indy walks to the kitchen. He eyes the paper with the phone number as if it looks back, he tiptoes towards it and touches its skin, front and back.

*It must be meant for me,* Indy thinks. Last night, in his panic, he grabbed the number on sight and called it immediately, only to get a busy tone and hang up. He then called his parents’ numbers but they never connected. He looks at the paper again—it had not moved or changed since the night before—and wonders what he could expect. Maybe they’re on a camping trip somewhere. Maybe they had to go to a funeral or visit a sick relative. If he called again, would he hear his mother’s voice?

He stands for a minute, touching the paper with his right hand and rubbing his waist with the left. *Stupid, stupid, he thinks. If I hadn’t blocked them for so long, they would have told me directly.*

Indy kept a copy of the keys to the apartment when he left for college. The only other keys were—are?—with his parents. Why would they give him a number that wasn’t theirs? Do they not have service where they are? He googles the number, as if it would return any results. He texts it, *Hello?,* then puts his phone down. He calls it again.

“Hey.”

Indy jumps at the response. It had only rung once.

“Hey,” Indy says, still gathering his voice. “Can I ask who this is?”

“Um, you’re the one who called, buddy. Wrong number?”

“Wait,” Indy blurts. “Wait. Okay I got this number from a piece of paper given to me by my parents. I can’t find them right now and I—”

“Wait.” The voice chuckles. “Inzamam, is that you?”

With this smoky, frayed voice, sounds and colors flood his head. Laughter, beige and white walls, shoes and music and birds chirping. Then come the images and the memories with them. Movie nights in his living room with high ceilings. Smoking in the bathroom after Indy’s breakup. Walks to the cemetery. Desks stacked with papers and books. College and internship applications.

“Ahmed?”

“Yooo! Inzamam, bro, my bad, I should have known. Shit, sorry for the confusion. How are you doing?”

“Damn, it’s good to hear from you. It’s been a while.”

“Yeah. Yeah, for sure.”

“Ahmed, where are my parents and my sister?”

The line was silent for a second. “Hm. Have you spoken to anyone else?”

“What? About this?”

“Yes. It’s important.”

“No. You’re the first person I called. I don’t know what’s going on.”

“I thought so.” The voice at the end paused and Indy could imagine his friend pinching his beard while he thought. “Yeah, you need to get out of there as soon as possible.”

“What’s going on, man?”

“I can’t explain everything over the phone. Listen. I’m at my place right now. Why don’t you stay over while you’re here?”

“What are you talking about, man?”

“Look, I know we haven’t talked in three years. But do you trust me?”

“What?”

“Do you trust me, Inzamam? We’ve known each other for like almost ten years. You trust me, right?”

“I guess, man…”

“You have to get out of there for your own safety. Come here and you can—”

“My own safety? Can you please tell me what’s going on?”

“It’s hard to explain. Trust me. You’ll be fine, just come and stay over and we’ll talk about everything here. Just get out of your house. Lay low. Don’t talk to anyone.”

“What the fuck, man?”

“Indy. Freaking out isn’t gonna help. You can either take my advice or risk being alone. Are you gonna come over or not?”

Indy pauses. The pressure on his chest returns. “I’ll come over tonight.”

“Ok. The sooner the better but it’s up to you. I’m texting you my address again. Wait, you changed your number, right? Is your Facebook still deleted?”

“Yeah. Sorry. This is my new number. You can text me here.”

“Elusive ass. Okay. I’ll see you tonight. Try not to freak out. I’m just making sure you’re safe.”

“Thanks, Ahmed.”

“See you soon.”

Indy is returned back to the apartment. He had been pacing around so much he had gone from the kitchen to the living room without noticing. His head hurts and he feels an overwhelming sense of thirst. He opens the cupboard and takes out a cup—he still remembers where they are, apparently—fills it up with tap water, and chugs it. His head still hurts, and his chest feels tight. He thinks about Ahmed and his warning, he wonders if his mother is alright. *Fuck it, he thinks.* He shakes his head and takes a deep breath. *I need to take a walk.*

Indy spends his day with Jackson Heights. He leaves his apartment before noon and walks down 82nd, leaving his luggage and phone behind. It’s cloudy outside. Indy wonders if it will rain later. The apartment complexes loom over him and he feels he is being watched, but the people that pass by him don’t seem to give him a second thought. Mothers dressed in shalwar walking their children to the park, Spanish-speaking middle-aged men selling fruit on the street, elderly people crawling in and out of the classic coffee shop on 37th. Indy passes them and wonders if they notice him as he notices them. He walks down Roosevelt Avenue, past Mexican, Salvadorian, and Argentinian bakeries and restaurants. He walks south, through the historic district of Jackson Heights, where the old and retired white people lived, towards the Chinatown of Elmhurst, and he sees the ages and ethnicities of people blend and mix on the borders between them.

When Indy was in high school, his primary goal in life was to find a well-paying job and buy a unit in the historic district of Jackson Heights or Elmhurst. He used to walk to the district on the weekends and sketch the buildings, shading in the red brick walls and square shuttered windows. He would take liberties with the greenery in the front and the cute white awnings over the front doors, though he spent most of his time drawing the people in the foreground: people imagined or real and forgotten.

As Indy continues to walk, occasionally something would pass his sight—a building, a person—and behind it he’d see himself, an Inzamam sitting and sketching, walking into a building or talking to someone he couldn’t see. He would feel some connection to this person, like he was part of some lineage, but then he’d blink and Inzamam would vanish. He keeps walking, left alone, feeling like he was being watched, feeling some emptiness in his soul.

Indy reaches Broadway and walks West, back towards Jackson Heights, until he sees his favorite deli with its obnoxious *Halal Food & Deli* sign in the corner of the window. As he walks in, he expects to see Abd-El-Kader behind the counter, but instead he sees a man who looks related, though Indy does not recognize him and the man does not seem to recognize Indy.

It is around this time that Indy starts to feel that something is wrong, that something deeper is culminating underground or out of his vision. He stands, looking at the person behind the counter, and he can’t tell if he was staring back out of curiosity or something else. The air in the deli is heavy, the leaves outside the store keep whirling in circles, rushing someplace, and he hears a faint ring near his left ear, a ring that becomes a sharp, white noise, then a scream, then a voice that he could swear was calling his name.

“Boss. Boss! Ay, what do you want?”

“Hey.” Indy shakes his head and looks back at the Yemeni man. His voice is clothed in a thick, Arab accent. His eyebrows are lush and horizontal, his eyes brown and deep. The man is skinny, much skinnier than Abd-El-Kader, but he also has a wide and scruffy beard. *I wish I could grow a beard like that,* Indy thinks. Indy notices a scar on his forehead, a deep one that looked like it hurt a lot ten or twenty years ago.

“My bad, were you talking to me?”

“There is no one else in the store, my friend.” The man raises his eyebrows at Indy in expectation.

“I’ll just have a pastrami.”

“Roll or hero?”

“How much is the roll?”

“Prices above my head, my friend.”

“I’ll just take the hero, I guess.” Indy’s head still hurt. He felt thirsty again.

“Bread?”

“Uh, I don’t know. Regular?”

“Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, mayo, what you want?”

“Just get me the regular. I forgot my order.” Indy rubs his forehead as if that would help.

“One pastrami hero.”

The man turns to gather the ingredients. “Where you from?”

Indy notices more leaves running by the deli door. “Me?”

“Yes boss, no one else here. Where you from?”

“Pakistan.” The clouds are gathering outside and the wind almost seems visible. Indy wonders if it would rain.

“Ah, Pakistan. Karachi ah?”

“No, Lahore.” He thinks of Lahore and the air. He thinks of the sun in Lahore and he wonders if it was windy there too.

“Aap kaisi hai?” he asks. His Urdu accent is almost as good as Indy’s.

“Alhamdolillah.” Indy smiled at the man, but he wasn’t looking.

“Alhamdolillah. You Muslim, brother?”

“Yeah.” Indy thinks of the masjid nearby. He wonders if it is still active.

“Assalamualaikum, brother. All the meat here is Halal. You see it on the sign on the front. No need to worry, brother.”

“Thanks.” Indy wears a supportive smile to the man. Still not looking. “I’ve actually been here before, so I know.”

The man raises his eyebrows at the sandwich he’s making. “You live here?”

“Yeah. My family lives off 30th Avenue. Or like 31st. And like 80th or so.”
“Good, bro. I’m seeing many cops around there these days, my friend. Be careful. My brother almost got arrested just for walking and not having ID. Crazy, man.”

“Yeah. Crazy.” Indy looks back outside and estimates how many leaves are passing by the screen. Twenty, thirty, fourty. Indy wonders if the park could ever run out of leaves.

“Just be careful.”

“I will.”

Indy pays and takes his hero to the park. He sits on the most remote bench and opens his sandwich up. It’s soggy. Indy realizes he doesn’t like tomatoes. He sits with himself, sandwich in his lap, and lets himself think of Lahore. How different each place is, how different he has been, there, here, and in Palo Alto. Every place, from the air and the clouds to the way that the sun set, can bring out something different in him. The people, too, the way they look at him and the way he feels around them. Indy wonders if other people were real at all, or if they are programmed to act in a certain way, just fulfilling tasks they repeated day-to-day. He watches the birds disappear into the clouds. He walks to his apartment to pack up. He wonders if it would rain.

The first thing Zain told Zahra about the states was that the pizza was world-renowned.

“But isn’t pizza from Italy, jaan? Why would you go to America for pizza?”

“It’s different, Zahra. You have the New York pizza which is thin and chewy. Crust, tomato sauce, and cheese. And then you have Chicago deep-dish pizza, which is like a cake or a pie. Do you know that they call pizzas pizza pie? That one is the one most like a pie, the Chicago one. And you have other pizzas too. Many different kinds.”

“Why not just go to Italy for the pizza, Zain?”

“America is different, jaan. Many people immigrate there, Italian people too. They all immigrate and then they change and their food changes too. And then their children change the food even more, and they all combine together. Like the seekh kabob pizza we have here. Only in America do you have such many different cultures altogether in one.”

Zahra nudged her husband’s shoulder and he slouched so she could lie on him. She put her arm across his stomach and kissed his cheek. His smooth skin matched the beige of the couch they sat on. *Ami was right,* Zahra thought. *The ceilings are much larger in these new houses in Defence.*

“Zain?”

“Yes, jaan.”

“Do you really want to move to America? Or are you just talking of it like you do now and then?”

“I do, jaan.” Zain lifted his arm from around Zahra and scratched the skin around his eyebrows. “Inzamam is almost twelve years old. If he goes to an American high school maybe he can get into a good university as well.”

Zahra wondered how such casual conversations could turn into lifelong decisions. She would not have met Zain if her conversation with her mother had turned out differently. And now, she controlled her son’s and husband’s future with her thoughts.

“Zain, I think I want to stay here in Pakistan.”

Zain put his arm back around Zahra and rubbed the fabric on her arm.

“We do not have to go, Zahra. I am happy here with you.”

<br>
Before Zahra loved people, she loved places. She loved the space between the kitchen and the bathroom in the house where she grew up. She loved its musky sunlight and dust-ridden shelves, the window you could climb to the roof from. She would sit in that makeshift pantry and read, finding other places in her stories, meeting characters larger than her, immersed until her mother would call her to help with dinner or pray.

She loved the open area she found near the dumpsters in her school. She would go there in her breaks to sit by herself, sometimes with a friend, talking or just eating, occasionally walking down towards the gate to watch the cars go by. Zahra was told by her friend Zainab that she was an “explorer.” Zahra didn’t believe her. She had never left her hometown.

She loved her walks home and to school. She would always leave early or arrive late so she could go back and forth an extra few times, observing beggars cleaning car windows in hopes they would get paid, eyeing posh, light-skinned women wearing white tees and light blue jeans going into the hair salon. She walked on these narrow, sandy roads, feeling lucky to live in a safe area, feeling lucky to live in a place she belonged. But how could she know to feel lucky? She had known nothing else.

Zahra was not rich, but she was stable. She was not popular, but she loved school. Uncle Ravi had sent her to a private school as part of his deal with Aisha, and there, Zahra developed a love for learning, reading, and writing, all of which her mother said she was naturally good already. Her mother could not buy her gifts—she was paid in board and her daughter’s education—but Zahra didn’t mind, she especially didn’t mind because Uncle Ravi would give her a new book series on her birthdays, and she couldn’t think of more to want.

<br>
All Zahra needed was herself, her walks, and her books—nothing else. After Inzamam was born, she continued to read, and she continued to take her walks too. After Zain left for work, she would tell the maids she was going to run some errands and to look after Inzamam while she was gone. She found time every day, or every other day, certainly every week at least, until maghrib came early and the darkness followed her as she walked. She was on one of these walks when she learned her mother died.

Aisha had died suddenly and secretly. She’d been nursing a tumor for four years, likely something she knew about (the doctor said it would have been painful to keep), likely something she knew she couldn’t fix. She didn’t have any money for an operation—even Uncle Ravi told Zahra afterwards that there was nothing he could have done. Aisha died and Zahra felt blindsided, not only from her mother’s sudden death, but from herself, a self that was lost and yearning. Zahra walked for hours on end the year following her mother’s passing, but no matter how many laps she took, and no matter how many books she read, she could never find her compact and stable self that she felt she had had her whole life. That was when Zahra broke her illusion of independence, and it was when she poured all of herself into her family life.

<br>
When Zain asked her about America many years later, Zahra let it fester in her mind even as she said no. She saw her son struggling in school, her husband coming home from work frustrated, and she imagined the places they may inhabit in the states. She wondered if they would find a home in that country the same way she had found her home in Lahore.

One weekend, she woke up to see Inzamam watching TV with his father. They were watching some cartoon she didn’t recognize, or care about, because instead she was looking at her husband with his arm around their son—her twelve-year old Inzamam. Zahra stayed in the shadow as the sun rose to fill the room, then imagined them sitting like this in a house in America. The walls became white, the hallways narrower, the TV larger, and outside, the sound of cars honking and people shouting became a silence. The silence became a ringing, and she, along with Inzamam and Zain, was brought to a mountaintop, somewhere where the ice just melted and the air was clean and cold. Maybe it was the way the light touched their foreheads that morning, or the way Inzamam rested his head on his father’s shoulder, but Zahra believed in that moment that all she needed in the world was them, and she would need nothing else.

What Indy missed most about Yasmine was her voice. Her words sprinkled out of her mouth like piano notes, and on the way out, they would coalesce together, such that once the sound waves reached you, your ears heard what felt like one singular brush stroke, but a stroke with multiple colors and threads at once, as if each grain of the brush was colored differently, had a different thickness, and worked independently of the others. Maybe it was the way her tongue rolled in and out as she spoke, or how her throat pulsed in and out—you could see it from the outside—or maybe it was the pitch of her voice, the way it rose and fell like it was blooming, constantly, endlessly, like an optical illusion of a staircase always going up. Oh, her tongue, her neck, her voice, Indy could never forget them, how they looked and how they felt, and even as they fell further from him with each passing day, the distance only made him think of it more, wondering how she felt to him as his memory lost its grasp on her being.

After they broke up, Indy wondered if her memory sounded like that because he was in love with her, or if he was in love with her because of how she sounded. He wondered if her skin truly shined the way it did—like a light brown chestnut, smooth, round, and polished—or if it was his eyes deceiving him, if her long, black curls bounced as softly as he remembered them to, if her angled nose shrunk in the cold or if it was just the air between them when they’d sit together looking at each other fondly, cuddling for warmth, Indy’s hands pressing his fingerprint onto her shoulder and her arms. Indy was never able to test the theory, because even after they broke up, he was still in love with her, and when he tried to win her back one last time a year after they had started college, she cut him out of her life forever. But maybe he wouldn’t have tested this image even if he could, if he had the chance to break the illusion and see the desert past the mirage, the chance for her to become her and not the Yasmine he knew, the Yasmine who visited his head once every few days when he was alone. He was happy he didn’t have a choice.

When Indy reaches Ahmed’s house—walking past the short black gate, the driveway with stone walls on either side, through the narrow walkway in the front, into its brick walls, he sees Yasmine sitting on the couch on her phone, and he wonders if she’s still the Yasmine he once knew.

“Hey, my man Inzamam!” Ahmed smiles and hugs Indy in the doorway. Indy is still frozen, and he looks over Ahmed’s shoulder into the living room at Yasmine. She’s still on her phone. “It feels like I’m hugging a stick, man.”

“Not much of a hugger, I guess.”

“Ah yeah I forgot that about you.” Ahmed lets Indy go and takes a step back to welcome Inzamam into his house. “Welcome back!”

*I forgot how big this house is,* Indy thinks. It hadn’t changed at all. The white walls and the classic wood floors, brick fireplace, rugs hanging from the walls, clear doors in the back leading to the backyard, large windows, and the flat screen TV hanging on the wall with the beige couch across from it. Indy and Ahmed would play FIFA on that couch in high school. Yasmine is still sitting there. She is still on her phone.

“Are you gonna tell me what’s going on?” Indy asks. Ahmed shuts the door. Indy forgot how loud his door was. He leaves his shoes next to the shoe rack before the stairs.

“Yeah, I’ll get to that in a sec.” Ahmed locks the door and turns to Indy.

Indy motions to the living room. He presses his lips together in annoyance.

“Oh. Yeah. I was gonna get to that too.” Ahmed walks in front of Indy. “Mina?”

Yasmine puts her phone down and fixes her posture but she doesn’t get up.

“Mina?” Indy asks.

“Hey, Inzamam,” Mina says. “I still go by Yasmine too. Ahmed just found my Twitter and I’m Mina there. So now he’s calling me Mina.”

“My nickname is four letters too,” Indy says. Mina gives him an empty look. There is a lot of space between them, a whole living room’s worth of one. Indy wonders if he should walk closer or wait for Ahmed to. Mina pulls out her phone again.

“You got a nickname too?” Ahmed starts to walk over to the living room. Thank you, Indy thinks.

“I go by Indy now.” Indy smiles and follows Ahmed. Mina isn’t paying attention.

“I know I should have told you, Inzamam,” Ahmed says. “But I was scared you wouldn’t come.”

“It’s been three years man.” Indy sits on the stool of the grand piano in the corner of the room. “It’s fine.”

“That’s what I like to hear!”

Ahmed sits on a chair next to the couch. He’s closer to Mina than he is Indy. *Do I get up and sit closer to them?* Indy thinks. He feels uncertain. The setting sunlight starts to get into his eyes. Indy squints, then looks forward. Now Ahmed is on his phone too.

Indy looks at the clean wood floors, then up to Yasmine. The sight of Yasmine on the couch and Ahmed sitting next to her brings him back to senior year.

Indy and Yasmine—Mina—saw each other secretly. Not even their friends in high school knew. All of their romanticisms, flirting, hesitant physical contact, were concentrated in three places. Near the cemetery at night; in the common area-backyard-trash room outside the basement of the apartment complex next to Inzamam’s; and in Ahmed’s house. That house, with its brick walls on the outside and plaster walls on the inside, became their only solace from the outside world—it was their only solace from themselves.

Brick on the outside, plaster walls on the inside. They came over on Saturdays, when both Ahmed’s parents were out—his mother at her friend’s house, his father on a business trip or at a networking dinner—and that secluded house with high ceilings and an open floor plan became a part of Indy’s life.

Inzamam used to tease Ahmed. “A house in Jackson Heights? So are you a landlord now?” “Do you really need all that space?” The size reminded him of their house in Defence, except it looked American. Suburban. It even had a fence, though it was small, black and metal instead of white and wood. It made Inzamam jealous. Brick on the outside, plaster walls on the inside.

Ahmed eventually got sick of Inzamam’s negging. “We’re not as different as you think, Inzamam,” he said. “Look at our floors. We have the same wooden floors, the same color, that Jackson Heights vibe. We’re more similar than you think.”

But now, Indy looks at the floor, and he notices it’s different. The floor is clean—spic and span—and there’s no starch over it. Indy’s apartment has a clear starch, almost to suggest that instead of cleaning the floor they just coated it so it looked clean. He remembers his thirteen year old self spotting hair or stains on the floor. He’d try to scratch them out but his nail would stop short. It was like the stains were part of the design of his floors. But they weren’t a part of Ahmed’s floors. His floors were actual wood. He looks at the white plaster walls and wonders too: are the walls in his apartment plaster too or are they drywall? Is the decaying brick outside the same brick Ahmed has?

Brick on the outside, plaster walls on the inside.

“So you’re Indy now?” Ahmed asks. “What is with you guys?”

Indy felt embarrassed then felt embarrassed at his embarrassment.

“Don’t group me with him,” Yasmine says, still looking at her phone.

“I dunno,” Indy said. His hands are in his pockets now. “I mean it’s fine, I’m just saying.”

“Indy, huh? Cool, I can do that. I guess it’s less syllables.”

“Yasmine isn’t,” Indy says.

“I guess it’s not, huh.”

Mina looks up from her phone at the TV. “Can we drop this.”

Indy glances at Mina. “Ok.”

Indy looks at Ahmed for a second, then looks back at the ground, then back at the couch. Mina has her hair tied. She used to let it down. She’s wearing yoga pants and a t-shirt. She used to wear looser clothing. Indy looks at the windows to his left, to Mina’s right. Mina is still on her phone.

“I’ll be right back, I have to get something from my room,” Ahmed says. “Do you guys want any water?”

Indy and Mina look at Ahmed with blank eyes. Indy half-smiles at him.

“Ok. Be right back.”

Indy gets up. He walks around the living room while Mina stays on her phone. Two doors on his left side, on Mina’s right, mark their backyard. *I still can’t believe this guy has a backyard in New York City,* Indy thinks. Indy walks towards the doors and looks out the window next to them. He sees another fence. *Wait, why is Yasmine even here? Do they hang out now?*

“I’m here because my family disappeared.” Indy jolts his gaze towards the couch. “Ahmed told me yours did too.”

*Mina seems meaner now.* “Oh shit.” Indy doesn’t know what else to say.

Mina smiles. “Ahmed told me to come stay here.”

“Yeah he did the—”

“He told me, yeah. Anyway, we’re stuck here and we’ll continue to be stuck here so let’s just agree not to be awkward. Okay?”

“Yeah. I wasn’t intending on it anyway.” Indy hangs his hand on the back of his neck. Indy wonders if he should sit down. The only chair next to the couch was the one Ahmed was using. And he doesn’t want to sit next to Mina on the couch. Should he sit on the floor next to the coffee table? Stay standing?

“Cool. I’m gonna go back to Tiktok.”

“Wait. Uh. So did you just graduate too?”

“Yeah.”

“I did too.” Indy cringes.

“Cool. I’m gonna go back to TikTok.”

“Wait, are you not freaking out too? Do you know what happened to your family? Did this happen to anyone else? Or my family?”

“There’s not much—”

“Hey guys!” Ahmed pops into the room, holding an orange box with two cups for water on them. “I brought some Catan in case you guys wanna play. And some water in case you need it.”

<br>
Ahmed rolls a seven. Mina groans. Indy laughs.

“You always hoard,” Ahmed says.

“Shut up.”

Indy laughs. Mina doesn’t like Catan. He remembers that. He and Mina always end up fighting for scraps while Ahmed dominates the map. And Ahmed always falls asleep before he wins. Indy waits for her to say something, but she doesn’t.

“I think Doordash is here,” Ahmed says. “I’ll be back.”

Indy is sitting across from Mina on a chair Ahmed brought from the dining table. They’re alone again. “Hey.”

Mina is looking at her phone. She doesn’t even flinch.

“Hey so did you get the DL on the situation or like do I ask Ahmed? Like he still hasn’t told me anything.”

Mina’s hair isn’t very curly anymore. Indy wonders if she straightens it now. He wants her to move so he can see them bounce. Indy blushes. He feels guilty for a second. I wonder how she’s doing.

“Ahmed’s not gonna want to talk about it,” Mina says.

“What? Why? Is his family gone too?”

“No. He just doesn’t want to talk about it.”

“Huh?”

Mina straightens her posture and looks directly at Indy. Indy feels goosebumps erupt on his skin.

“He avoids the topic and he says he doesn’t know,” Mina says, still looking at Indy, “But he scratches his beard while he says it.”

“Doesn’t scratching his beard just mean he’s thinking?”

“No. Not that kind of scratching. It’s like more to the side.”

“Like near his neck?” Indy realizes his head still hurts from today.

“What? No. Like near his ears.”

Indy looks at Mina’s ears. “Whereas thinking is his goatee?”

“Yeah.” Mina leans back into the couch. Her short gold earrings dangle off her earlobe. “Ahmed just says they were probably kidnapped or abducted. Like maybe a hate group or just people who want a ransom.”

“That’s so random, man.”

“That’s why he’s asking me and you to stay here, to wait for more information. His parents are investigating, apparently. That’s what he told me when he called me. And when I said I was coming to Queens he begged me to stay with him for my own safety.”

Mina pulls out her phone again. Indy hears noises coming from it. Is that what TikTok sounds like?

“Anyway, that’s all I know, and apparently all Ahmed knows too.”

“What are you guys talking about?” Ahmed asks. He’s standing next to the front door with a plastic bag in his hand. His shoes are already off.

“Jesus,” Indy says. “How long have you been there?”

Ahmed chuckles. “I just got in, dude. Did you not see me?” He walks towards them, dropping the food next to the board and falling into his chair. “God, I love this chair.”

Mina is still on her phone. It seems like she hasn’t registered the conversation at all.

“We were just talking about our families,” Indy offered.

Ahmed sat up. “I know I said I’d explain everything here,” Ahmed says. He looks sideways at Mina and back at Indy. “But there’s not much to say.”

Indy looks at Ahmed and raises his eyebrows as if to ask for more. They aren’t exactly at eye level. Indy’s chair is slightly lower than Ahmed’s. That annoys him.

“My suggestion is to lie low while we figure it out.” Ahmed grabs the food that he just dropped and opens the plastic bag. Indy watches him. “But to be honest, even if we get anything, I’m not sure you guys should get involved.”

Mina looks up from her phone. Indy feels he should say something. “What?”

“Whatever the situation is, it’s dangerous for you guys to get too close to it. A third party, like my family, can handle it.”

“No way in hell that’s happening,” Indy says. Mina looks back down at her phone.

“Well, look. Either way, the best bet is to leave this to the cops and for us to go back to our lives. My parents meddling is already risky enough.”

“Fuck the cops, man.” Mina looks up at Indy and he can see a half-smile on her face. She looks pleased, and that makes Indy feel confident.

“They’re literally made for this job, Indy.” Ahmed distributes the to-go containers, placing Indy’s food on top of his resource cards.

“Dude, you’re gonna get them oily.”

“Sorry.”

Indy moves the container onto the floor.

“Whose turn is it?” Ahmed asks.

“Mine,” Indy says.

“Wait, orange is ugly. Can I switch out for white?”

“What?” Ahmed says. He’s smiling at Mina, ready to start laughing in case it was a joke. “Are you five?”

Mina glares at him. “I want white.”

Ahmed shrugs and gives her the bag with the white pieces.

“I’m not leaving here,” Indy says. “I just got here.”

“Do what you want. I’m just telling you what’s safest for you.”

<br>
Soon enough, Ahmed falls asleep on his chair. Mina and Indy clean up the trash and start walking up the stairs to the guest room. Indy follows behind her. He tries not to look up.

“Do you know why Ahmed kept nagging me about finding a job?” Indy asked. The hallway was narrower than he remembered. It was dark when they reached the top of the stairs. Indy forgot where the lights were.

“I dunno,” Yasmine says. She steps ahead of Indy and flips a light switch next to him. “He’s probably projecting, what with you going to Stanford and everything. He probably just wants the best.”

“He does get overbearing at times. I forgot about that.”

“He’s honestly probably jealous.” Mina walks into the guest room and Indy follows behind her.

“Really?” Indy closes the door. The room is bigger than he remembers.

“He used to be your role model, and then you got into Stanford.”

“I guess. I mean he still is.”

“He tries to be.” Mina takes an air mattress bag out of the closet. She plugs it into the outlet and turns it on. “Are you cool if I take the bed?”

“Yeah. Of course.”

“Cool. The bedsheets are in the bag. Night, Indy.”

“Night.”
