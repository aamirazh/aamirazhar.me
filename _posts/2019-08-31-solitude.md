solitude is torture

until it takes you away

until it sweeps you off your feet

until it hugs you night and day

<br>
solitude is love

until you’re left on your own

until you can’t find your heart

until you can’t leave your room

<br>
i look; look for it

for her, or him, or them

but i can’t love no more

can’t even love my friends

<br>
to love again

do i learn to love my friends

do i let myself fall in

or will she come again
