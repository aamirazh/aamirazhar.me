The fire ignites at the back of the throat. It spreads from fluids and oils, rushing down the throat towards the heart.

It started from the clay. The clay we were made of, the clay molded into our image, the clay we swore to return to. The fire is loving—the clay had created it—but it knows its purpose is to search and destroy.

The fire reaches the lungs. It suffocates the heart. The mind remains intact.

The mind recognizes its end—the fire’s beginning. It was not molded to live, it was molded to ignite. It was molded to scream, to burn alive, to fight and die in agony.

The eyes glimpse the skin as the fire eats the body inside out. The clay, the clay—it’s melting. It’s melting into bone, into blood, into ash. The eye melts too until its sockets are empty and the frontal bone leans over it. Finally. Finally. The clay is reaching its end.

The body collapses. The fire feasts on its remains. It yearns for more. It yearns for the land. Other bodies around it scream too. Some have collapsed. Others stand, resisting. Some smile as they are consumed.

We were never meant to live. We were never meant to survive. We were meant to cry with tears of fire. To love; to burst into flames; to love; to die; to destroy; to love; to love; to love, we were made to love. So love. And burn yourself alive.
