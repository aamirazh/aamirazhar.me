**Five minute free-write**

lost and searching

to make mistakes and know

my eyes find what they want

my heart is still worn out

<br>
in all my growth and war and loss

an insecurity stays

will i find myself in love

or will i grow away

<br>
will i have everything i wanted now

and what i wanted then

or will those needs and wants change

only to change again?
