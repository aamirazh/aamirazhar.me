Don't let the dust settle. Don't let it settle or it'll come, all at once, when you're unprepared but anticipating the change.

You'll be at your table, thinking, working, or writing, peeling an orange on your breaks, assuming life will continue to be — and it will.

When it comes, it will be grey. It will be grey, or silver, solid, bright in the light it's reflecting, but when you touch it, it will feel soft and gooey, and when you put your hand in the mass, it will swallow you, and you will be transported—clean and untouched—to a room like the one you're in, but it's inverted, or maybe it isn't, maybe you're inverted, and the ones you love are too, or they're gone, or new ones have taken their place. The orange peel is gone, the dust has been washed away and now everything in this world is such a blinding silver, it's so new and so overwhelming, and we ask ourselves: do we change with the tides, or do the tides change us?

So is it trespassing if you knew it would come? Is it crisis if you were ready? Can you find it before it finds you? Because the only way to win is to release your desperation, it is to forge ahead, to catch the changes as they come, beat the portal to its own destination, it is to forget the semblances of what you once had, or maybe not forget, but to leave them where they were, in the world that you once knew, a world that you do not inhabit, a world you cannot return to. The portal has disappeared, your eyes start to get used to the silver, you sit at your desk, and you continue to be, you continue to be as you always have, in this new and old place, in your new and old body, trapped and intimate with your new and old self. Go there or be brought there — you will deal with change, you may even change yourself, and we will all find ourselves in and out of love and in and out of dreams, as and after they come and go.
