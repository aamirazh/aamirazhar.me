Mom was aerating the rug out in the lawn—if you could call it that, it could be a porch, or a sidewalk, or just a space with some plants—when we saw it. The rug was lavish—or that's the word mom used when we bought it at the Sears closing sale—bold blue with a white crooked spiral, some red shapes here and there, and what looked like honeycombs grouped in the middle in a circle.

Chris was puttering in the kitchen, I think his college apps were due around that time, and I think he was finding himself (growth triggered from a personal statement prompt). I was nine, and at the time I was dressed in overalls — I remember because that was last day I wore overalls, and since then I've refused to wear them. I was given one for my twenty-ninth birthday (Chris said the stitching was minute, whatever that means), but I had to regift it, I still wasn't over it then, or now for that matter.

The monster, or phantasm, crystallized in the living room, its skin looked soft and wooly (like a yeti or a mammoth). It must have been uncomfortable, and hot, since it was the middle of the summer in the South. And whatever dimension it came from, presumably, it hadn't eaten in a while, because it walked over to me—I was frozen, maybe out of fear, or curiosity, or just awe—took the chocolate out of my hands with its great big paws (its claws were huge, and I winced when they grazed my overalls), and promptly popped it into its mouth.

Once it finished eating the chocolate, Chris and I watching it closely, the room illuminated (the sun may have found a good angle), and the monster decided to go home. Had it come for the chocolate, or for me, maybe mom or Chris? Either way, we never saw it again. I never wore overalls again either.
