Love you’ve left my heart

And left it such since severed

Now the sun will fall

The clouds will come together

<br>
Memory invokes

The love we first endeavored

Grown apart and yet

I still remain untethered

<br>
August marks the end

As distance grows in measure

Bodies may forget

But time will reremember

<br>
Know I do not fear

The sharp grasp of November

If I've loved you once

I've loved you for forever—
