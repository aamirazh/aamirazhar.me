This album is a masterpiece. The layering, the way Tim plays with noise, nature, and sound, how he hides behind chaos and then lets it fall away to elegance, or simplicity, constantly tugging at this tension between what is considered noise and what is considered music... this album gets better every listen. Certain times in this album bring me to tears when a song overwhelms me with its emotion, or when a chaotic song comes to a clearing and I feel my mind cleanse as the flood waters recede.

Like the second half of Virginal II, when the piano notes—literally imprinting them into your brain for the first three minutes—fall away to reveal a beautiful, organized synth progression. Or in Live Room and Live Room Out, when the chaotic piano bows to the slow and sentimental clarinet. Or after Virginal II, when the album becomes sad, lonesome, unsettled in Black Refraction, then transitions into the tentative Incense at Abu Ghraib, finally finding itself in the layered, beautiful, haunting flutes of Amps, Drugs, Harmonium. Or in the last song, Stab Variation, where the pulsing of the synths literally feel like they're stabbing you, and it gets noisier and noisier until it gets to some clearing where you can see everything and nothing at once. Beauty and contrast, beauty and contrast, constantly, overwhelmingly in this album.

Tim, with this album, is playing with this concept of highly edited or highly layered sound, and how it is changing our relationship to music and sound for good. In this age where music has no technical constraint, what is music anymore? What can it be? What is its relationship to what came before us? This album feels like a Jackson Pollock painting, just layers of chaos thrown on themselves, but when you take a step back, or listen to them together, an entirely new product emerges. That product is neither the sum of its layers (each layer perhaps representing a "virginal", elementary sound) nor a product entirely divorced from its source. It is in this middle ground—bastardization, push and pull between noise and clarity, that Tim Hecker shines. This album is beautiful, and it is genius. It is chaotic and elegant, it—being in the margins—is everything at once. And yet, it feels like something entirely new.
