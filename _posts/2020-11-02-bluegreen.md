the moon shining blood,

reminds me of

the trees and the sky

blue:green, as they turn

to yellow:red

in cycle, then wane

descending,

moonlike,

into black

<br>
as fall is evening

and spring is dawn

and the leaves and the sky cycle yellow to red

(fall: evening)

then descend into black

(night: winter)

what brings them back?

to blue, green,

return to themselves,

not the other;

only meet in persimmon,

the color of fall.

<br>
i hope the cycles are kind

and when the red fades to black

that it’s soft, temporal; like sleep

but not—

unlike death
