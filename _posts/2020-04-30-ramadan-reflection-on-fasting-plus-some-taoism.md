Salaam all - I am back with some Ramadan Reflections (with some Taoism sprinkled in)!

Recently, I've found myself talking with non-Muslim and Muslim friends on what the purpose of fasting is. I wanted to share some insight from Al-Ghazali's Ihya Ulum-ud-Din (The Revival of Religious Learnings) that I stumbled upon while reading today, plus some Daoist verses they reminded me of. (if you want to see Al-Ghazali's ten benefits for hunger, which is the context, that's at the end after my musings)

This quote, I feel, succinctly captures the essence of fasting, which is a "grounding" of ones desires to reality, a reminder that one's desires are a means to an end (and not something to be pursued blindly) — essentially a separation between the soul and its desires, in an effort to control and remove oneself from its intoxication.

This is a theme I have noticed is present in Daoism as well — the understanding of spirituality as an attempt to grasp the Nothing, what is not there. This is parallel to Islam's purpose of grasping and worshipping God even if He is invisible (belief in the unseen); I would even argue the purpose of all (or most) spirituality+religion is to grasp Nothing, and in doing so, be able to grasp Everything; to only be able to grapple with Existence through understanding non-Existence (or transcendent existence, what may exist outside of our own existence). To be able to handle Everything once you have experienced Nothing (finding strength in weakness, desire in the undesirable, grasping the Soft, the Indistinct, the Unclear [the Tao]).

We come from Nothing (or dust) and we return to Nothing — our existence in the middle is a mere blip on the radar, and through our anxieties and desires it is important to remain grounded to our "roots", which is Nothing, or God, or the Afterlife. (It may be blasphemous to equate the concept of afterlife to nothing here, but I hope you understand that both are transcendent concepts. Nothing, in this context, may simply mean what is incomprehensible to this world, what is transcendent)

Su Che, a Daoist scholar, argues, “People see things constantly changing and conclude something is there. They don’t realize everything returns to nothing."

See attached images of verses from the Daodejing (43/78/22) which I think explain this concept perfectly.

Anyway, to return to the topic at hand, Al-Ghazali outlines ten benefits to hunger / fasting which I found to be insightful (this is summarized and does not include the countless Ayat/Hadith Al-Ghazali takes this wisdom from):

1. "Hunger makes the heart pure, conduct fresh and sight sharp. On the other hand, over-eating makes one lazy, heart blind and incurs heat in brain like intoxication, even it attacks the men of thoughts."

2. "Hunger makes the heart soft and pure and therewith the sweet taste of Zikr [devotion, rhythmic repetition of prayer] and Monajat [supplication] is felt."

3. "Another benefit of hunger is the breaking of heart which produces modesty. Pride and enjoyments are removed by hunger. A man does not understand the power and glory of God till he does not feel absolutely helpless..."

4. "Another benefit of hunger is not to be forgetful of God's punishment [as well as the plight of the poor and hungry]."

5. "Another benefit of hunger is that the propensity of committing sin is brought under control. Hunger arrests the greed for committing sins and controls the propensities of evils. The root of all sins is greed and physical strength and the root of these two is satisfied eating."

6. "Another benefit of hunger is sleeplessness. He who eats to his heart's content drinks much, and he who drinks much sleeps much." [I found this to be interesting, given that I and many Muslims complain about a lack of sleep during Ramadan due to the schedule — Al-Ghazali argues that this is a benefit!]

7. "Another benefit of hunger is that divine worship comes easy. In case of excessive eating, one becomes lazy and idle and so divine service becomes difficult. [It is an indulgence which can be replaced with worship]."

8. "Another benefit of hunger is preservation of health and removal of diseases. A little quantity of food improves health and removes diseases. Excessive eating accumulate diseases in stomach and veins."

9. "Another benefit of hunger is little expense. If you practise little eating, a little expense will be sufficient."

10. "Another benefit of hunger is to be endowed with the attribute of charity and of giving up self-praise. One who keeps himself hungry and thirsty removes the hunger and thirst of another with his own meal and gives in charity his excess food to the orphans and the poor."

Quran, 7:31 - Eat and drink but do not squander.
