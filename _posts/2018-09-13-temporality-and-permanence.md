Time is cruel to all people.

Its ways unintuitive, coarse, and cold.

Our bodies restricted, but time eternal, unable to reconcile.

Time and man, divorced and disjointed, yet integrated in circumstance.

Meld together by God's hand, an inhumane partnership.

Forced into intimacy until one meets its end.

<br>
To time, all is the past, and the past is all it provides.

To man, all is the present, and the present is all perceived.

The past, permanent, the present, passing.

<br>
This defective congregation, this broken marriage, bears a child of anxiety and grief.

As man, ever remorseful of time's past, is furthermore paranoid of the future.

A future that exists in the mind, but nowhere else. A hallucination, nonexistent but real.

Haunted by the past and future, yet unable to exist outside the present, he lives in fear.

A fear of time, of mind, and of himself. A fear born with flawed existence.

<br>
For what is the future but an illusive specter of the present?

And what is the past but a fable enforced upon our present selves?

And what is the present but a dream itself; fleeting, only realized 'til after its end?

<br>
Time itself is deception, a siren whose recognition stirs doubt and woe.

For the past is eternal, the future hypothetical, the present evanescence in drifting souls.

Life is but a meager whiff of smoke, commanded by the gales of an imagined future and the sleet of an everlasting past.

Why are all the wrong things temporary, and all the right things permanent?
* Temporary: Life itself, friendships, happiness
 * For example, whenever I experience something good, I know it will end. The memory lasts, but the happiness doesn't.
* Permanent: The decisions we have made in the past, our past experiences and how they affect who we are

The past is permanent, but the present is temporary. The future doesn't exist outside of our imagination.
* The past is too real. It is a constant.
* The future is in our heads. It is a dream.
* We are stuck between the past given to us (by our previous selves, who are not us right now, and by God, and history),
* and the future we dream of, but will never know, control, or touch.
* The present is all we have, but it is weak, brief, and fleeting.
