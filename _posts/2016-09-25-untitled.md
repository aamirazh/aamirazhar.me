do you remember when we first held hands?

i remember thinking

your hands fit so perfectly in mine

as if god designed my hands

for the specific function of holding yours

and now that it finally found its purpose

i just wanted to stay there forever

but you let go

and after my hands

you let go of my heart

why?
