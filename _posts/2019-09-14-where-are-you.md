all it would take

is a deer

or a preoccupied car

to smash my head on the windshield

and lose what's within

<br>
all it would take

an afterthought, a mistake

to exile me and be done with it

<br>
accelerating in the dark

ears blasted, eyes widened, heart open

i feel i am ready

not for the act, but an accident

a slip of fate and a timed or mistimed consequence

i ask for forgiveness; i hope for no harm; but i wish for this still

<br>
a story to report on the next day

a life to be mourned, then moved on from with time

the world to be still for a second, for everyone, or just me, then to resume in its beauty again

<br>
i wish to go, but not to leave

to be victim to circumstance, as i always have been

to be tragic, unlucky, but not crazy or depressed

to have tried his best and been met with futility

<br>
is that not what i deserve? a narrative of struggle and failure, at least for myself if not others?

not a charity case, a pathetic victim

but a tragedy, a true tragedy, a twist of fate, as i am

but tragedy needs happenstance, or accident

intentionality means my will; hence my consequence

<br>
and ive tried in this life. ive tried to fight. i want grand tragedy, not pitifulness

a dying wish, and even that ungranted

(even that ungranted)

(to live in despair or to die in shame)

<br>
i push the pedal, 70, 80, 90, and i pray

i look for a slip, deer, tree, and i pray

it doesn't appear. it doesn't appear. i wait, and it doesn't appear.

please, this one thing, that's all it would take

where is it? WHY-

and it doesn't appear
