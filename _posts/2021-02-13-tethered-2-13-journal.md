The memory is tough and meaty. Its fibers are flexible but unbreaking. Its home is the ground; it hardens into the cement, then attaches itself to my feet.

I look up at the sky. It is clear and unconcerned. I look forward at the road. It is spongy and precarious. A cloud of steam emanates from a hole inside, fogging my sight while the planes fly well above it. I walk slowly to the hole. The memory allows it.

The hole opens. I see bodies underneath. I see screams and laughter, love and solitude, swirling around in a spiral leading to the center of the earth. I step—I’m pulled—into it.

My ears ring. My skin is pulled and reshaped around my face. At first, I resist. They scream into my ears—jealous, abandoned, misplaced. Then, I smile. They are me. They are all me, and I open my body cavity and let them into my soul. I scream from pain. I smile; I love them; I look down at my changing body and I laugh. I laugh as it speaks.

That to love your past is not to love the people who were in them, but rather yourself who had experienced it.

They bring me back above the cement. The fog has cleared. The clouds gather above the ground. I step. The memory allows it.
