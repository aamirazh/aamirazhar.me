I gathered in

The white rains

of Toronto

Waters

Washing

Torrential falls

<br>
It was gleaming

Sunlight pinching

Stiff hairs on

My skin roaring

To the mist

“Find me now, God!”

Find me

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now

I gleaned it

In the breathless

Closet of

My memory

Trapped in time

Then I vanish

The sun is out

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am

Gathered

In the white rain

of Toronto

I love you

And goodbye
