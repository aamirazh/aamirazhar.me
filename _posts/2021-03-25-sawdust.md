Sawdust

Or when it's falling like rain

The trees can never leave their roots

The eye is unrestrained

<br>
Sawdust

As my truth remains unsaid

The clouds are looking down at us

The planes fly overhead

<br>
Sawdust

Then our bodies will give way

Our legacy returns to bones

Soil glowing with decay

<br>
Sawdust

And the sky is falling down

I miss you like I miss the sun

With distance. Underground.
