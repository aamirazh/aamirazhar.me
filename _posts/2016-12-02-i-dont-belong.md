i speak low

no sound comes out

my once passion light

is now fogged with doubt

<br>
id love grand

love full and whole

but my spirit drowned

ive lost all control

<br>
as i fall

i reach for help

but i look and see

that theres no one left

<br>
id shine bright

shine bright and proud

but i realize now

im a smoke-filled cloud

<br>
do they know?

my woeful me

my pathetic truth

is it unconcealed?

<br>
im a fool

im too naive

hopes of profound love

were just me deceived

<br>
ill live alone

live where i need

so i cant lash out

with such reckless dreams

<br>
life is vain

an empty mass

my type cant belong

and we never have
