stuck in my head

cant get it out

it breeds a craze

it feeds my doubt

<br>
it pushes me

until it wins

i fight it now

but hope will end


<br>
consumed by it

it's all i see

i now accept

i wont be free


<br>
my self is gone

im just a shell

am i alive?

i cannot tell


<br>
theres no escape

it never stops

it's building up

i feel its throb


<br>
see, if i could

id kill it now

yet i confess

i dont know how


<br>
cause it is me

and i am it

i dont know life

without this itch

<br>
the only time

i know im me

is when im in

this misery

<br>
so i must live

live with this dread

ill only win

when i am dead

<br>
but is it far?

or is it near?

when will you win,

anxiety?
