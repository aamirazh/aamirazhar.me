The insect digs into the ground. I stand on the surface watching. My mother calls to me from the yard. The ants disappear beneath my feet.

The house is yellow and new, yellow and new, khaki-colored—not the greyish, neutral khaki, but the ugly yellow khaki that hurts your eyes—hurts my eyes, I should say, because I don’t understand beauty, and I certainly don’t understand color, the reason trees and leaves are green; yes, I know of chlorophyll; I’m asking why, not how, like the sky reflecting a pleasant blue until the yellow sun dips under the horizon and the light stretches and the furthest rays scatter the blue and violet, bestowing on us reds and oranges—red, the color of fire, the color of change, so if green is yellow and blue, do the trees then contain within them the sun and the sky?

I don’t know, I don't know, and besides, my mom’s still calling—I think she needs help moving a box, or setting the table, and I should help because I’m her son, a member of this family, and I’m certainly not a tree, nor am I the dirt underneath it; I am certainly not the sky, and God withstanding I'll never become the sun.

I’m coming mom, I’m coming. As soon as the ants finish burrowing under the log, as soon as the sun disappears behind the hills.
