the sound’s call

of distant birds

(they fly in circles)

and in their

silences

(crevices)

*nothing*,

and when did silence get so loud?

ears ringing,

my mind expands to

fill the empty space that

surrounds me;

I feel alive.

I feel whole,

loud,

small,

and fragile,

like a child.

<br>
I wonder, does

crying feel

`sad | happy?`

`surprised | knowing?`

`nostalgic | hopeful—`

<br>
It feels like rain.

Yes, it feels like rain,

comfort and loss,

bodies joining the earth;

ah, what an honor

if our tears could evaporate

from our cheeks

to join the clouds

only to fall once again.

<br>
and I feel it now

that tears are not happy or sad

but vulnerable,

how the Ego disintegrates,

the way our bodies melt

into the soil we grew out of,

return to the earth we came from

to join the droplet’s cycle

of life, growth and rebirth
