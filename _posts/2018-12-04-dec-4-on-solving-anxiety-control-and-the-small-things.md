Today didn't start out anxious. I had a decent morning—rushed, but it felt normal, and having my parents and cousin around was something I got used to the last few weeks. I was flying back to NY after spending some time at home (in Durham). I slept a bit and read on the flight, and made it back to New York for an appointment with a therapist (I'm still shopping around, so this was my first "interview" with him). It went alright, work went alright, everything felt Normal. I was working with adulthood, unpacking these changes, figuring out who I am. Not easy, but Normal.

I started feeling rushed around 3pm as I was having multiple meetings in a row, and I couldn't stop thinking about something the senior manager in my team said in our daily standup: that, when I was talking about the new project I'd been super excited to undertake, we would need to "talk" about that later. When he said that, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach, a feeling of helplessness, due to a fear that this project would be cast aside, and I'd be assigned to the more "important" support and infrastructure work I'd been doing the last few months, the work I've been trying to get out of in favor of something more interesting, something I was better at.

I didn't get a chance to sync up with him, so I had to continue with my day. I had another work meeting, and barely made a 5pm appointment with the Islamic Center of NYU chaplain, Imam Khalid Latif. I updated him on my life, asked for advice, and it was overall a helpful, productive conversation. He told me to listen to my heart and find what makes life feel more "light" to balance out the inevitable heaviness that comes around. And to really unpack what it is: is it going to his sermons at ICNYU on Fridays, or is it the general ambience of spirituality and community? Is it the boba at 9pm, or is it putting myself in the mindset to write and take a breather? Is it the commute, or is it being able to walk/ride things off and reflect instead of feeling stuck in a room? Things change, life changes, but I should try to train how I speak with my heart, how I listen, and the language I talk to myself with (is it an exhausting 30min commute to Manhattan for an event, or is it a short, relaxing 30min commute to an event I'm excited about?) This, ideally, can help me find that "lightness" when I feel it most, and pick up on opportunities to fulfill myself when they arise.

Despite the productivity of the conversations with Imam Khalid and my therapist, I still felt anxious after it all. After a breakthrough the last few weeks of feeling more comfortable in my own skin, coming out of depression, and starting to love myself again, I was concerned at the sense of feeling unlike myself again.

So, as I went out for dinner, I thought about my anxiety. Thought, maybe too much. Tried, maybe a little too hard, to find the cause.

Is it exhaustion? After all, it was an exhausting day. I had two appointments, multiple work meetings, and I just flew in this morning. Could be. In that case I should just eat and rest and I'll feel better, right?

Is it the environment switch from being in a suburban family home to a huge city alone? Could be. In that case I should establish a routine here, and think about what kind of environment I want to live in, and I'll feel better, right?

Is it a feeling of fundamental loneliness and a lack of community in a newly established adulthood? Could be. In that case I should explore more community spaces, build up a support network, and unpack this big life change and I'll feel better, right?

Is it work, and the frustration I've been feeling about trying to establish a routine and work on projects I find interesting? Could be, I mean my anxiety definitely started around then. In that case, I should try and solve the problem, reevaluate my expectations for work, and maybe look into different options and I'll feel better, right?

It was very likely that it was a combination of all these factors, and probably an infinite number more. If that's the case, do I do all of these? Like at once? And find the other factors and solve them too? What?

I take a deep breath. Okay, I know in cases like this that my anxiety is pretty irrational. And pretty much every time, when I get better, I barely notice. It just happens, and I only notice a few days later that life regained its normality and "lightness". So, I tried to stop thinking about it. Maybe I should just wait for it to pass. But that didn't work either, it only made me feel jittery and idle.

I realized today this fundamental problem of my anxiety. Thinking about it, and being obsessed with solving the problem only adds more noise, chaos, and uncertainty. Surrendering to it, and being idle (or lazy) while waiting for it to pass only makes me feel more helpless and restless.

I soon realized that neither of these was the solution. The solution (if it can be called one) was to find habits and support systems that I can turn to when anxious, rituals that help me take my mind off myself, that aren't too ambitious or energy-draining, but aren't entirely idle or stagnant instead. The hardcore reflection can come later when I have more energy, the exhausted lazy idleness hopefully never has to come at all.

This realization didn't fix my anxiety immediately, but it actually lifted a significant weight off my heart. I felt less "responsible" for "solving" my anxiety here and now (anxiety happens, take care of yourself and let it pass), but I also felt less "helpless" (perform simple actions to help reset your mentality, and trust that eventually you'll feel better).

So I did it. I decided to go to a community Halaqa at the Islamic Center, and the spirituality of the space helped refresh me. It didn't fix my anxiety, but I felt a bit better, and my heart felt more spiritually fulfilled. I read a book on the train and listened to a nostalgic, calming album (Tim Hecker's Ravedeath, 1972, if you're curious—a masterpiece, the best ambient drone album I've ever had the pleasure of familiarizing myself with). It didn't fix my anxiety either, but I felt a bit better, and my heart felt more paced and patient. At home, I made tea and decided to journal this. And now, I still feel a little anxious, but I feel a bit better, and my heart feels more listened to, a little more optimistic and recharged. Each step was only a marginal improvement, but compared to just 4 hours ago, I realize I'm feeling so much better overall.

It's really the small things. It's the slight mentality shift where you don't pressure yourself but still empower yourself to overcome your struggles. It's the small little routines, those tiny decisions you take on to take care of your heart a bit. It's the simple, but powerful acts of love you show yourself, to feel that it'll be alright, and you're doing your best.

It doesn't help unpacking this all in an environment (and a stage of life) where I feel fundamentally independent, fundamentally alone. Where I live all but a couple hours of the day by myself, and I come home to myself, and wake up with myself, no one else holding a significant presence in it. Especially in a city like New York, where there's millions of individuals but seemingly no communities, it feels I'm really working with the bare bones of myself, thrown into the deep end of the vast, unexplored ocean of my inner self, with no one else in sight. I'm still getting used to that, but it's also a unique opportunity to work on myself with no 'crutches' (though I hesitate to call loved ones crutches, since they are necessary and important). (I'll most likely write about this independence and loneliness in the near future as it's on my mind too.)

These growing pains start and stop randomly, often flaring up with multiple anxieties at once, or disappearing entirely for a short, sudden period of clarity or peace. But these pains are mine, they are part of life, and I feel I'm beginning to learn to work with them. Not **solve** them, not **surrender** to them, but work with them. Work with them, work with my heart, and work with the world in a sustainable and meaningful way. But as always, only God knows what lies for me down the line, and only He can guide me in this journey in discovering myself. I only pray I do my best and stay proactive, but can also accept whatever awaits me down the line. Inshallah.
