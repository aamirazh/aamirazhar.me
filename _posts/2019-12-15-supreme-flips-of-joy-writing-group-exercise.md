Supreme flips of joy.

It's easiest to enrobe a pretzel in chocolate when you start with the bottom.

If only I was serving them to someone who deserved that intentionality.

Holding on to the bitter crystallized pieces of salt despite sweetness melting in my mouth.

Completely immersed in chocolate, I could no longer remember which side was up.

Right side up, upside down, I taste the same all around.

Tongue pressed to the roof of my mouth, I search for a ridge of direction.

But did I want to stop drowning?

The chocolate all-encompassed, was it sweet, was it heavy â€” where was the surface?

It's okay to leave a thing half-eaten.

#### Faster and more spontaneous iteration

We love chaotic energy.

It sounds like Ryan's three bands spaddling each other.

Pooja solves a Rubik's Cube five times.

Mastering all sides of the force.

Where was the force born again?

Wisconsin?

Hillary didn't go there enough.

That balloon has flown, baby.

Pop!
