from nothing comes something

and from something comes nothing

to make something from something

is to lose the way

<br>
we are abstractions, something, we are worldly

yet we come from nothing, to nothing we will return

why run from our roots? this will only result in pain

to be long-lasting, to be peaceful, is to be consistent

to be short-lived, chaotic, is to be ambitious

<br>
exchange amplitude for wavelength

lower frequency and approach linearity

<br>
to be consistent is to be close to nothing

to be ambitious is to want to be more

something, even a thing, even a Thing

that is far from nothing, far from our nature, far from our roots

<br>
from nothing comes something

in our something, we must not lose sight of nothing

in this world, it is easy to find things

entertainment, story, drama, success, humiliation, ups and downs

it is hard, fleeting to find nothing

<br>
but to find nothing is to find ourselves, it is to find our essence

we strip away all things, and we find nothing

our soul is nothing, but it is the most real

our body is something, but it is the most ephemeral

<br>
we are worldly abstractions

we are loud, visible, we are grand

but we must find the source, the hidden source, the silent source

the source that is fleeting, but consistent (everlasting)

not the abstraction that is clear, but temporary (everchanging)

<br>
find your nothing

return to it
