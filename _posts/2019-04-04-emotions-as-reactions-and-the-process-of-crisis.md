In my early 20s, a new crisis (or two, or three) seems to come by with every new moon. They are so abundant that I've almost resigned myself to them.

"Here comes another episode where I question the validity of my dreams and doubt my capability to fulfill them."

"What's on the menu today? Ah yes, a breakdown about loneliness and the fear that I will never be loved."

"I haven't thought about how I look recently. Why not wish I talked / looked / acted differently and hate myself for a bit?"

I've found, experiencing these Common Crises (C<sup>2</sup>), it is very easy to approach these big questions in a backwards, reactive way. I mean, to start with, I'd avoid thinking about them as much as possible, while also letting the insecurities influence every minute decision or experience I have. Then, on occasion, I'd have a bad day, and everything would come crashing down at me at once. I'd project my anxiety onto these unanswered questions which would trigger a reactionary manic episode where I over-plan (or just fantasize, or melt in despair) until it's over. Then, I'd avoid it again until the next crisis. Rinse and repeat.

I think the most recent crisis I had was a couple weeks ago. It happened around the time when multiple friends of mine happened to flake on plans in one week. I was generally frustrated because many people I met would want to hang out, but they would also assume I'd take responsibility to plan and reach out (even after flaking), which would make me feel taken for granted. I felt fairly lonely, and had a couple of bad days. And one day, I crashed. I was tired and exhausted and thoughts were swirling around my head after work.

This anxiety led to heavy reflection on the State of my Social Life. Like I always do when I feel manic, I overreacted and thought endlessly about what I was doing wrong, how I could fix everything. Was it that I didn't have enough friends, and needed to go to more random events? Maybe I was investing in the wrong people? I mean, maybe I'm just bad at socializing and don't know how to connect to people. It could be my circumstances too, living in New York mostly alone, far from most of my friends, even those in NYC. Maybe I should just live somewhere else. I'm sure my job is related too, since I don't talk to people in the office very often. So should I find a different job too?

I managed to turn a couple bad days into a whole crisis on how I approach my social life, where I'm living, my job, even my personality. Those are big questions. Like questions you don't solve in a night, let alone a month, even a year. So what was I to do? Asking this only overwhelmed me even further. If I can't fix my life now, am I just doomed to suffer until something big changes?

It's easy for this kind of thing to happen, especially when you feel a lack of direction in your life. After all, how are you supposed to answer these big questions when you have no idea where your life is going? Like I can't even decide what outfit to wear on a given day. How am I supposed to work through my deep-set anxieties and paralysis about my career? But let's take a step back. Where do these crisis episodes come from? More specifically, **where do the emotions that trigger them originate?**

When I think back to that day, obviously it wasn't like someone came up to me and told me my social life, career, and personality were a mess. Contrary to what movies tell us, the days we have crises tend to be fairly normal. Nothing extraordinary really happened that day. I mean, I slept a bit late, and skipped breakfast. I was kind of tired and irritable throughout the day, and my assignment at work didn't work the way it was supposed to. Plus I had an awkward text conversation with a friend, but none of that was a big deal. I didn't particularly care about these things (breakfast, the exact timeline of my project, some random social interaction), so I ignored them. But in the evening, before dinner, it all piled up on me.

And once I started thinking about all the ways in which my life was going wrong, asking all the big questions, I was a goner. Which leads me to wonder: is there a better way of doing this?

Whenever I'd have a bad day, I would always default to addressing the big questions as my primary problem-solving outlet, and it took me a long time to learn that these crises aren't actually triggered by them directly. The two can be related, sure (I'll expound on this later), but the big questions tend to be logical, or logistical problems. Our emotions day to day aren't supposed to be about them. It's a lot simpler than that.

In fact, **we shouldn't be automatically reacting to our emotions in the first place, because emotions are reactions themselves.** If you think about it, emotions are your body reacting to stimuli—nothing more. They don't have meaning in and of themselves. They're just a way for your body to tell you something is wrong.

When we feel emotions, we often default to crisis, meticulously unpacking our life situation. But in reality, our moods tend to be impacted by smaller stimuli, stimuli that, when overlooked, may lead to us jumping to these bigger questions without addressing the original situations that caused these states of mind in the first place.

The small, decentering things—an offhanded comment someone makes, a skipped meal, a tiring work call after lunch—they aren't given much thought generally (after all, they're menial, even trivial). But it takes one small thing to make us feel off for the rest of the day. This applies to how we react to situations as well as how we react to people — small discrepancies in our day to day can end up making us wholly dissatisfied with a situation or relationship at large. We even project frustrations from some parts of our life (let's say, work or school stress) onto others (let's say, insecurities or grievances in our relationships).

I'm sure, by now, you're saying, "But Aamir, aren't those smaller things caused by the bigger things? Isn't focusing on the small things futile if we ignore their origins?" Or you're not. I can't read your mind. While I agree with you, let's hold on a bit. I'll get to that later.

First and foremost, before we get to the deeper things, we can't do anything until we actually identify our triggers. This requires being mindful and self-aware (which honestly is a lot to ask for already). So what are your triggers? What are your emotions telling you, and why do they come about? Again, the big things (an unsure future, career prospects, where to move) are "logical" and logistical — your emotions aren't necessarily dealing with such complicated matters yet.

Maybe you feel sad or insecure because someone you trust said something negative about you and it subtly shook your understanding of yourself. Maybe you feel frustrated after dinner because you set a subconscious goal to get your assignment done by the end of the day and it's still not working. Maybe you feel overwhelmed because you didn't eat a good lunch, and your body is in stress mode. We need to stop dramatizing things, stop acting like we're "bigger" than the small things. The small things are real, and they impact us, and they also trigger these larger insecurities about our identity. They shan't be ignored.

Now, this doesn't mean to avoid the "big" things in life. In fact, what happens when we do is we only end up confronting them when we are emotionally compromised. Many of these questions are larger logical or logistical questions, so it's better to unpack them over time in the right state of mind. Not to mention, they take a long time to work through, so it's fairly ill informed to try and sift through it all in the span one emotional breakdown. And that way, when we do get emotional, or have a bad day, it doesn't push us into panic mode, trying to solve all our problems at once — We can focus on the small things on an ad hoc basis instead of relying on manic episodes to push us out of complacency into productivity.

But again, if we laser focus too much on the big things, it can become very easy to exaggerate them. Some of our crises could be nonissues entirely, instead representing insecurities we default to when we feel anxious or off center on a given day. Only once we find consistency in ourselves, and are able to check in with ourselves on a regular basis, will we able to process things in a healthy manner. This means addressing the big themes in our life, but still remaining mindful and present on a day to day basis as well.

Through all this, I found one piece of advice especially useful: **You are what you do, not how you feel.** It really is how we respond to our emotions that defines us, not the emotions we get. Because at the end of the day, we can't really control our emotions. They are reactions provided to us from our subconscious, little warning lights like the ones you have in your car's dashboard. It's futile for us to resist the very act of feeling; we should work on how we respond to these warning lights rather than focusing on the lights themselves.

Sometimes the warning light can be ignored, sometimes we just need a quick checkup, other times we may need an oil change. But regardless, it's just a warning light. The car is still running (presumably). And through it all, it will continue to run. So let's keep on keeping on!
