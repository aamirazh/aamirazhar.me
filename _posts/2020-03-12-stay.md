I'm standing. My toes sink into the grass, grasping them, like I could be pulled from the sky at any time. There is a door to my right. I am indoors, the painting looms over me like a shadow, it is telling me, "Stay, stay. I am yours." All the while, it is grey, the paint is chipping, it is crooked; the figure has its back turned towards me, they are looking at something, towards something, and they are floating further and further away.

I remember seeing their eyes. I remember the painting looking at me as it spoke, touching their dimples as they smiled, tracing my finger across their scalp, forming it, loving it. I still love it. I will always love it. It is mine. They are mine, they say they are mine.

As gravity inverts, and my toes fight harder to stay grounded, my head turns, my eyes look upward, and I see the light, I see its grasp, and I want it to consume me. And yet, I hear the sound of the trees, they call meâ€”or is it the painting, speaking to me? It calls me, the trees moaning in unison, "Stay, stay. I am yours. Bring me with you, if you must." And yet the figure is floating further from me, until they are part of the background, and yet I can see them turning back to me, joining the trees, mouthing its words, saying, "I would love to."
