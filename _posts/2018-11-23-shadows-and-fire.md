cemented shadows in my room, in my soul

scrounging through my heart, where was the life i led before?

<br>
hidden, hidden, please open up

shifting, shifting, please find yourself

<br>
adjusted to being lost, unreciprocated by myself

where did i go? will i return?

<br>
there, the light flickers, did you see it?

a silent ray of light from the crack of the door

<br>
was it a trick of the light? then-

the room is lit on fire. my heart bursts into flame

<br>
my light, my self, like ra, reveals himself

darkness relinquished, sight restored

<br>
i love myself. i can love myself again.
