cemented shadows in my room, in my soul
scrounging through my heart, where was the life i led before?

hidden, hidden, please open up
shifting, shifting, please find yourself

adjusted to being lost, unreciprocated by myself
where did i go? will i return?

there, the light flickers, did you see it?
a silent ray of light from the crack of the door

was it a trick of the light? then-
the room is lit on fire. my heart bursts into flame

my light, my self, like ra, reveals himself
darkness relinquished, sight restored

i love myself. i can love myself again.
