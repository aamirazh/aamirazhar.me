it was a winter that broke me

freezing winds that numbed my heart

my bones decay from lonesome howls

my soul doomed from the start

<br>
winter rose and winter razed

all of us were hurt

shootings, heartbreak, losing self

inside and out it struck

<br>
grief to cripple any

can't see past the snow

the flurries wild, our love denied,

when will we be ourselves?

<br>
40,000 deaths from bullets

50k from losing self

when will it end, but also how?

what do i do till then?

<br>
i ask:

i know we all seek hope, but why's it always fade?

cause my eyes light up sometimes but it leaves just all the same

<br>
i ask:

why me? why now? why's the weather out so harsh?

but my voice is drowned amongst the gales, i speak it by myself

<br>
i ask:

why can't we try once more? when winter passes by?

but maybe winter never ends, and this is our bleak life

<br>
i ask:

please don't leave me, but don't keep leading me on too

im sick of fighting for something i never understood

<br>
so maybe the roaring 20s

is about this storm's deep cry

a moan, to mourn, but never pass

this depression never dies

<br>
so i don't know if winter leaves,

or if it just repents

cause sunlight comes, but sunlight goes

and winter comes again
