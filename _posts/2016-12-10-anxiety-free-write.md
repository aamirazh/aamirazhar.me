bleeding fingers

scars from a war with anxiety

the inability to function

<br>
wanting to fly

but not wanting to get off the ground

<br>
where am i?

<br>
i need to move but i dont know where

i need to fight but i dont know what

i need to love but i dont know who

<br>
where does this come from?

i think back to my past but all i see is grey

<br>
i am stuck in a box

unable to move and unable to express myself

i reject it but it does not disappear

why doesnt it disappear?

<br>
the symptom of an overactive brain

the symptom of big dreams and endless passion

the symptom of loving too much and too fully

the symptom of trying to find meaning in a cold world

the symptom of trying to change a world that does not care for you

<br>
i want someone to hold me

but i am too stubborn to seek out help

this anxiety has only ever known me and i have only ever talked to it alone

how will it react to visitors?

<br>
i am too independent for my own good

i refuse to rely on anyone

refuse to allow outsiders inside

refuse to trust anyone but myself

<br>
i have been hurt

people are the reason my anxiety is so strong

so how could i believe they can help?

how can i trust again when all it has done is make things work?

<br>
i am not sure if i should open up or close off

if i should trust or reject

if i should unite or isolate

if i should love or hate

<br>
anxiety.
