Original poem (fragment 31):

He seems to me equal to gods that man
whoever he is who opposite you
sits and listen close
    to your sweet speaking

and lovely laughing—oh it
puts the heart in my chest on wings
for when I look at you, even a moment, no speaking
    is left in me

no: tongue breaks and thin
fire is racing under skin
and in eyes no sight and drumming
    fills ears

and cold sweat holds me and shaking
grips me all, greener than grass
I am and dead—or almost
    I seem to me.

But all is to be dared, because even a person of poverty

Rewrite a poem with the opposite meaning:

he found me once in Paris
he loved me till we died
our flowers wilted, and I returned to home
did he miss me when I’d gone?

it was nothing; but I loved him;
his scruffy hair and smooth, olive skin
his laugh, my laugh, then we’d make love; I looked at him and
    my mind and body return

myself returned and then I left him
he picked up the pieces I had lost
I loved him; I found through him myself, his words and his eyes
    coalescing into my mind

now I think of him and forget
what were the shape of his ears?
my hands rest on my lap—his hands I forget the touch of
    I live and he is dead

and I move, as even as things end, I remain

<br>
Rewrite an E-Lipogram (without the letter e):

Is as our Gods, that man
across from you
sits and looks
    to your words

and laughing—oh it
throws my soul aflight
for as I look at you, no sound
    stays in

no: mouth split and thin
sparks within my skin
and in i, no sight and drumming
    fills my mind

and cold soaks and shaking
grips my all, viridis grass
I am and lost—or almost
    I am to my own

But all is fair, as a vagrant may
