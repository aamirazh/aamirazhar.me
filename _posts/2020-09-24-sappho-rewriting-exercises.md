Original poem (fragment 31):

He seems to me equal to gods that man

whoever he is who opposite you

sits and listen close

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your sweet speaking

<br>
and lovely laughing—oh it

puts the heart in my chest on wings

for when I look at you, even a moment, no speaking

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is left in me

<br>
no: tongue breaks and thin

fire is racing under skin

and in eyes no sight and drumming

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fills ears

<br>
and cold sweat holds me and shaking

grips me all, greener than grass

I am and dead—or almost

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to me.

<br>
But all is to be dared, because even a person of poverty

<br>
Rewrite a poem with the opposite meaning:

he found me once in Paris

he loved me till we died

our flowers wilted, and I returned to home

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did he miss me when I’d gone?

<br>
it was nothing; but I loved him;

his scruffy hair and smooth, olive skin

his laugh, my laugh, then we’d make love; I looked at him and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my mind and body return

<br>
myself returned and then I left him

he picked up the pieces I had lost

I loved him; I found through him myself, his words and his eyes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coalescing into my mind

<br>
now I think of him and forget

what were the shape of his ears?

my hands rest on my lap—his hands I forget the touch of

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live and he is dead

<br>
and I move, as even as things end, I remain

<br>
Rewrite an E-Lipogram (without the letter e):

Is as our Gods, that man

across from you

sits and looks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your words

<br>
and laughing—oh it

throws my soul aflight

for as I look at you, no sound

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stays in

<br>
no: mouth split and thin

sparks within my skin

and in i, no sight and drumming

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fills my mind

<br>
and cold soaks and shaking

grips my all, viridis grass

I am and lost—or almost

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am to my own

<br>
But all is fair, as a vagrant may
