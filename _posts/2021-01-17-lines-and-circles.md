مفخر تبریزیان شمس حق و دین بگو

بلک صدای تو است این همه گفتار من

"Sun of Truth and Faith, pride of Tabriz! Speak!

—but it is your voice that mouths all my words."

*Rumi, Ghazal 2056 (Translated by Franklin D. Lewis)*

<br>
I first awoke outside on the longest winter night in Ohio. The cold and tempered air ran through my nostrils into my lungs. The silence penetrated my ears. My eyes opened. The stars boasted their heat in the sky. I shivered. The moon was hidden; its cycle was completing, and the new moon was to return in a few days. My eyes adjusted to the dark, and I placed myself. I was standing on gravel in my socks, long t-shirt, and shorts. I knew the way back because I heard the river down the road and to the right, before the cows and hogs. I lingered for a second, a minute, then turned and walked home.

The door was unlocked. I tiptoed into the house, which looked foreign from the front at this time of night. The whole downstairs was covered with shades of black, dark walls and darker floors inviting silhouettes and shadows to lie on the ground. A sliver of light peeked from under the basement door. The floor creaked every few steps as I walked to it. I opened the door slowly to allow my eyes time to receive the light. I squinted at the stairs. A voice escaped from under them.

“Is that you, honey?”

“Mom?”

“What are you doing up, dear?” I heard the whisper of plastic and the thump of something heavy on the floor. “Here, come down, I have some benadryl here.”

“Benadryl?”

“It helps you sleep, honey. Come down.”

Something in my gut told me to go back to bed. I was not sure if this was a dream. “I’m going back to bed, mom.”

“Night, then. I love you.”

<br>
The next morning, we were greeted with snow. I walked downstairs to find my father reading on the couch and my mother at the kitchen table drinking coffee.

“Morning, sleepy,” my father said.

“When did it snow?” I asked, my voice cracking through the wordlessness of my sleep. It felt like I hadn’t spoken in days.

“Last night sometime. Just a couple inches.”

“Come have breakfast,” my mother said to me. Her straight hair almost touched the shoulders of her blue collarless blouse. She looked at me with love, but her eyebrows faltered and a hint of quiet sadness passed her face. I saw wrinkles on her face I had not seen before. As I sat at the table, I felt a distinct sense of pity for her, though I could not place where it was coming from.

“How did you sleep, honey?”

“Bad,” I said. I shut my eyes and opened them up again, raising my eyebrows to wake myself up. I noticed I had almost grown to my mother’s height, which made me feel pride, then pity again, then fear. “Pancakes, huh?”

“Pancakes!” my mother exclaimed. The hint of sadness was gone from her face, and now she beamed with glee.

“Did you read last night, dear?” my father said from the couch. His voice was deep and it intimidated me, even if the words he said were amiable. I saw the back of his frame rising over the grey couch. He was wearing a dark blue and black buttoned flannel shirt, his small head sprouting out of his bulky frame like an afterthought.

“No, dad. Sorry.”

My father grunted. He put down his book, stretched, and got up. As he walked towards us, I caught a view of the fireplace planted in the living room wall. On its left was a black stand holding iron tongs, a poker, shovel, and a brush. To its right was a vacuum to remove the ash and behind it were branding irons we used for the cows scattered on the floor. Something sparked in the fireplace. Flames stretched up, then disappeared, then others took their place. I stared at it and soon started to feel its heat. No matter how different each flame was, how fast and far it rose and fell—blue, red, orange—no matter the irreplicable combination, it was always just a fire. Despite its heterogeneity. Despite its beauty.

“It’s important to read, sweetheart.” My father melted into the kitchen table chair and his body assumed the structure it gave. “I’ve told you.”

“Yes, dad, I’ll read tomorrow.”

“I—” He sat up and leaned forward, glancing at something behind me. “I’ve told you that you can do anything you want in life, as long as you can live off of it.”

I nodded. I looked curiously at his face. His skin looked supple, youthful, except for a scar on his left eyebrow. I wondered if he put on moisturizer this morning. I traced the vein on his face down from his short, wavy hair to his prominent, confident chin. *Macrogenia*. The vein was always visible—it was a birthmark—and it always led to and ended at his jaw, which followed naturally to his chin. *Macrogenia*.

“I know, dad. I’ll read tonight.”

“But language is important. It will help you no matter where you are. It will even help you in your relationships. With the right words, you can be—”

The chair creaked. “Sorry,” my mother offered. “Getting more pancakes for everyone.” She hummed quietly as she walked to the kitchen stove.

My father looked at the plate in front of him, then cut off some pancake with the side of his fork and placed it in his mouth. I wondered if he would take me to help shovel the driveway. I imagined us together, moving snow, silence swelling between us, encapsulated by the scraping of shovels and the deep sighs of my father hard at work.

Farm work had been my favorite way to spend time with him. While most daughters learned how to bake bread, mend clothing, and clean the house, my father taught me how to tend the livestock and how to pump and haul water to the barn, and he did so not by instructing me, but by showing me. For years, I followed him around and watched him—he would forget I was there and continue with his chores, occasionally catching me in his eye and offering a smile or nod. As I watched him wipe sweat off his brow, I’d think he was the strongest, most disciplined person in the world. At five or six, I learned to help with small things, like grooming the animals and raking leaves. At nine, he let me shovel snow with him. We performed our chores and physical labor in silence together, then when I was old enough, I performed in silence alone.

I watched my father eat his pancake, then stared out through the back porch at the trees that surrounded most of our farm. The sun was still hiding behind them, but I knew in an hour or two it would rise above, lighting and warming the closer half of our living room. My mother would turn off the fireplace, my father would go outside for his walk, and I would watch the clouds wade through the sky, hoping they didn’t try to cover the sun like the trees tried to do before.

“Why aren’t you eating, dear?” my mother asked.

“I don’t really have an appetite this early.”

“Well, this is the last call for more pancakes. Do you want any?”

“I’m good, mom, I’ll just have what’s left over.”

My mother walked over with four pancakes on a white plate with blue flowers lined on the side.

“Mom, that’s way too much for us to finish.”

“Oh, shush,” she said, grabbing her cup of coffee with her right hand and walking over.

“Careful, honey,” my father said. “Looks wobbly.”

“Wobbly! I got it.”

“You sure you don’t need—”

My mother’s shoulder twitched and her wrist gave way to the plate and pancakes crashing down. She grasped at what had fallen, only to miss, grazing a pancake as it slipped out of her hand. The plate shattered into pieces with the pancakes falling on top of it. The last pancake—the one that escaped her left hand—withered onto the floor with a disappointing thud.

My mother looked up, coffee cup still in her hand—some coffee splashed onto her right arm and blouse—and offered an appeasing smile to us. The smile made her look like a child. It proved her guilt, and she kept it on as my father got up from his chair and walked over to the mess.

My father never took his eyes off of her. He snatched the coffee cup out of her hand. “Fucking bitch,” he said, with the same deep voice he used before, except it was sharper; it reverberated off the walls and into my ears. “You can’t do anything right.”

He walked back to the chair with the cup. My mother kept standing there, perhaps up to a minute or two, with the same look on her face of apologia and fear. I could not take my eyes off of her. That look she gave him—gave us—I recognized it. She wore it after her miscarriage last spring.

<br>
I always imagined him as a boy. Twelve year old me imagined us sitting together as I read in the living room, imagined him sitting on his high chair as I fed him applesauce and juice. My mother told me he was due in October, and I thought of little him coming home to marvel at our Christmas tree, with little flakes of snow on his nose and cheeks, yawning, first clenched and eyes closed.

Then came April. Winter was receding, the clouds cleared and the sky confessed a pleasant light blue—winter, with its blacks, whites, and greys was giving way to spring’s proud greens and blues. I was finishing up the seventh grade. My mother had to go to the hospital for a few days; my father told me she was just sick, but I knew it had to do with the boy.

She came back with my father on a warm Friday night. Her skin was pale, and I remember thinking she left part of herself in the hospital. I could not tell if it was spiritual or physical, but I knew she wasn’t entirely there. She gave me a weak smile and shrugged, then turned away and walked upstairs with my father. Her smile was what told me. It apologized.

That following night was short. I woke up at dawn with ease. It was quiet downstairs, and I tiptoed to avoid waking up my parents. I walked to the front door and let the sharp air whoosh past my body into the house, like it was coming home after being away, like it belonged with us inside. I walked outside and greeted the birds. Our farm was small, smaller than the other farms in the area. All we had were cattle, some hogs, and soy, everything surrounded by trees on each side and fences at both ends.

The image of my mother’s face distilled in my mind. It was the same face she gave my father when she forgot to pick up the medicine, the face she wore when looking out the window towards the stream running next to our house—seeing that face, I knew she wondered, I knew she yearned and felt shame; though she did not speak of it, she kept it close to her heart, and it kept her sensitive and absent-minded. My father raged at her when she forgot to turn off the heater before leaving, he raged when she drove too slowly on our road trips, he would say: *Get these words through your thick skull* and she’d say nothing back. Her only defense was that face, with its consolatory smile and her hesitant, teary eyes.

I wondered if he yelled at her in the car or in the bedroom that night, perhaps about her diet, something she did that he told her not to do, and now it was her fault something had happened to the boy—her undisciplined self who, according to him, could barely take care of herself or her child, let alone help him tend to their house and farm every day.

I walked down the gravel road to the cattle and hogs, and the open skies and endless fields communicated to me a profound sense of nothingness. Emptiness and silence filled me whole. I felt accepted. There was nothing for me to justify, nothing for me to be. The world around me was timeless, undefined, and I felt then a conviction—I remember these exact words ringed in my head—to *let it be*.

The sun peered down at the cattle grazing. The cattle must have noticed me as I walked to them, but they knew I was no threat, and they didn’t care to acknowledge my presence. The cows and bulls were fat and well-fed. I had always been amazed at their size, I had been for years, ever since my father helped me feed them when I was six. I always wondered why they let such frail humans control them and give them work. We owned them. All of them had letters and numbers on their rear, some enclosed with circles, some sideways or upside down, some with legs or wings or little chairs to sit on. I identified the marks on one of the cows—she was my favorite, I called her Betty—fat with a short tail and udders dangling, visible behind its legs.

I knew how to read them. My father taught me the script and he even let me brand one of them. This one was: Crazy A, Walking 3, Rocking Chair.

I walked away from the pasture and towards the trees that lined our farm. One tree stood out to me, it was slanted, branches fractal, with a thick one on its right curving down to form an arc pointing back to its trunk. *Crazy C*, I thought. And that became its name. I sat at its base and mourned a brother I did not know was dead. Whatever was wrong with him, I mourned him, and after I got up, the sky was filled with clouds and I knew God was apologizing to me too.

<br>
The second time I woke up outside was on Christmas Eve. The air clouded my sinuses and I felt something in my head that needed to be released. My eyes were closed and I placed myself with my ears. I was further down the gravel road, next to the river but before the sleeping animals.

The river whispered things in my ears. They were not words, not even in another language, but I knew it was talking to me. I stood there, listening closely; higher pitches mixed with lower ones, and I caught a pitch that reverberated through my head. But what did it mean? What was it telling me? I could not listen, as it was unspoken. I could not understand, as it was true.

I opened my eyes. I looked at the sky. The new moon had come. The clouds covered most of the stars. I yearned for the new year, when the crescent would arrive and this year would leave us.

I left the river with its coalescing scales and walked towards my house. The night sky looked warmer; dawn was due, but not for another few hours. The house, growing larger as I walked towards it, glowed in the nighttime, like it was radiating something. Something about it was different, but I could not describe it. I walked inside, and I saw my mother facing me, sitting cross legged on the dining table, one arm folded around the back of her neck and the other around her waist. To her right, my father lying on the couch, head up, chin lodged into his chest, watching the fireplace burst into flames.

But their eyes were closed. Were they waiting for me to come back? This was not my home. These were not my parents.

I could see words floating down the stairs into the living room, but I could not read nor hear them. I knew they came from Him. I followed them and walked upstairs. They were coming from the nursery, which was my father’s study now. The walls were still its pleasant mint green and the baby blue crib still waited in the corner. I tiptoed into the room, and there I saw the source. My eyes felt like they were melting in my sockets; my ears swelled with each step I took. It was there, in the crib, and I caught a glimpse before I collapsed. Those unspoken words…

<br>
Morning came and I found my parents downstairs again. My father was on the couch, wearing the same buttoned flannel shirt. My mother was sitting at the table again. I sat in the same spot. I looked at both of them. My mother smiled at me.

“Do you want more pancakes hun?”

“No,” I muttered, my voice cracking again. “No, I’m good.”

My mother hummed to herself as she ate. My father was still reading on the couch, blocking my view to the fireplace with his head and body.

“So,” he started. I knew what he would say. “Winter rea—”

“Dad, I’m done with reading.”

The room dipped into silence as my father got up slowly. He stretched, then turned to face me.

“You’re done with reading?”

“Yes, dad.” I sat with my hands in my lap and tried to look confident the way he did. I could tell he was not angry yet, just curious.

“And what prompted this behavior?”

“The truth is unspoken,” I whispered. I remembered that from my dream.

“Hm?”

“The… I—” my voice started to tremble. “I don’t trust it,” I said softly.

“You don’t trust reading?” My father walked over and towered over me, still with a tentative look on his face.

“Language,” I said, my voice still soft and unassuming.

My father’s laugh filled the corners of the room like flooding water.

“Do you trust your sight?”

“Guys,” my mother interjected. “Cut it out, please.” She looked at my father. She reached for his hand but he stepped away. “Let her have a break if she wants to, love.”

“Do you trust your sight?” my father repeated, his voice louder this time. I looked up at him, then down at the table. His face—looking directly at me—was morphing into anger; I knew it wouldn’t be too long.

“Yes, dad.”

He took his eyes off me and I sighed, freed from their captivity. “You trust one thing your brain creates,” he said, walking back to the couch to get his newspaper, “But not the other?”

I used my freedom to gather my voice together. “Words will never express reality,” I said, almost as loud as him. “Words will never express reality,” I said softer, as if correcting myself.

My father grabbed his newspaper and walked to the chair at the head of the table. I looked at his brown eyes, at the vein on his cheek. The vein was larger now, and the scar that interrupted his eyebrow was red.

“Maybe,” he said slowly, easing himself into his chair. He looked at me, then took a deep breath. “Maybe, you’re not good enough at it.”

I said nothing. My mother got up to make more pancakes. I stared at her to tell her to stay, but she avoided my eyes.

“Maybe words can,” he said. I knew he was playing with me; his voice was rising with every word he spoke. “But have you considered that you’re just.” He cleared his throat. “Not good enough?”

Something deep inside me stirred. I couldn’t handle this. I couldn’t handle him, neither his voice nor his words. “I don’t care,” I said. His vein was larger now, and the redness on his scar was spreading to the rest of his face. Even sitting down, he still towered over me. “I’m not reading anymore!” Tears welled up in my eyes, out of anticipation more than anything else. I knew it was time, and yet I couldn’t stop talking.

“It’s useless,” I cried. “It’s useless, stupid, it’s not fair and it’s a waste of time.” I lost control; I couldn’t see my mother or father, only the words coming out of my mouth. “The truth is unspoken. Why try to speak it? Who are we to distill this,”—I threw my hands up in the air—“Into lines and circles?” I was shouting now.

“Into lines and circles?” I gasped. “LINES? And CIRCLES?”

<br>
Silence. I looked at my father. He was smiling; it was a disgusting, evil smile. His eyebrows were crooked and his cheeks bulged up to his eyes. The smile communicated success. It communicated satisfaction. It told me he had won. It etched its image into my mind.

“You’re frustrated,” he croaked, his smile intensifying. I looked to my mother for salvation, but her back was still turned. “That’s where it starts.”

Then my father walked upstairs, that smile still staining his face, and he disappeared. I put my head in my hands and didn’t let go. I heard and saw nothing. I thought of the crib in the study. I thought of the cow, then the tree, the skies and the moon. My mind made its way back to the crib again, the crib… with those words…

<br>
When I raised my head out of my hands, it was dark. My father was sitting at the table again—he was reading now—and my mother was still at the stove. The room was doused in a gentle darkness; shadows from the fireplace scattered about the room.

“It’s a solar eclipse,” my father said, softly. His voice felt gentle to my ears.

I got up without saying anything and walked out the front door. I knew I had to follow the trail I had walked those nights. My mind was clear and empty. Down the gravel road, past the water, through the silent cattle, and towards the big tree I had found in April. My brother was there. He was laughing, as He did, and I heard the bell of a tricycle ring. I could not locate the sound. I walked under the tree and looked up at the sky.

The sun’s light was pierced by a black, circular object. Now, the object was nameless, and it was extraordinary. Darkness fell upon the cattle and the fields, onto the house—onto the earth—and I thought of the dinosaurs, saw them dying slowly from the black smoke that filled the atmosphere. But on the edges of the black, some light escaped, and it spread to the edges of the sky in rays—no gradient, just lines coming from the circle. Lines and circles.

“What an honor,” I said to myself. “What an honor it would be if I could die from this.”

And I looked at the magnificent sky, the object in its center, and I bowed to it. The nameless sky was my Lord. It did not need a mouth to speak to me. It did not need hands to show. It simply was. On that vast and empty plain, under the tree that held my brother, I cried. I cried, then I looked up and stared forever. The sky was my Lord and I loved it. Whatever it said, I’d repeat. Whatever it did, I would enact. Whatever it was, I would embody.

<br>
On the way back to the house, I saw Him behind the shed. A boy with a smile. A boy with a ball. A boy with a bike. A boy with a dog. He rode along and disappeared. I knew I was not to follow.

I walked into the house and my mother smiled at me. She was sitting in her seat at the kitchen table. My father was on the couch sleeping. The room was still dark, but the fireplace was majestic, and I followed the shadows in the room as they danced on his forehead and chest.

I sat next to the fireplace and admired it. In the grey of the room, the flames burned bright, so bright that their images printed themselves in my eye. They crackled loud, each crackle at a different frequency and volume. I heard the river’s music in the crackles coalescing. I saw the tree’s branches in the fractal flames. They fell into smoke like the grey sky. And I took the closest branding irons from behind the vacuum and dipped them like I was roasting marshmallows. They were welcomed by the flames.

“Honey, what are you doing?” my mother said from the kitchen table. “The fireplace is nice, isn’t it?”

I didn’t respond. I touched the neck of one of the irons, and my finger stung, then turned numb. It was still too cold. A minute passed. Another one.

“Do you want more pancakes, dear?”

Now it was ready.

“Dear?”

I pulled the irons out of the fire, stood and held them, trembling, ends away from my legs.

My mother stood up and turned to me with concern. “What are you doing with those, dear?” My father twitched in his sleep. I walked towards the couch.

With one hand, I ripped open his buttoned shirt. He stirred and squinted at me. I held the irons with both hands and pressed it against his chest. His screams filled the air and joined the smoke. My mother gasped and fainted on the floor. I smiled. I smiled the smile he gave me; it was my smile, it was ours.

<br>
وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَـٰمٌۭ وَٱلْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍۢ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَـٰتُ ٱللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌۭ

And were all the trees on earth pens and the oceans ink—with seven seas to replenish it—the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Indeed, Allah is all-Mighty, all-Wise.

*Quran, 31:27*
