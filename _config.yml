title_description: "My name is Aamir Azhar. I'm a 22 year old aspiring writer who is currently.. a data engineer. This blog is mostly going to be my hub for writing practice, which includes creative writing, poetry, and social/political commentary (feel free to sort my posts by category under the 'All Posts' tab). Hope you enjoy, and please feel free to leave a comment or message me with thoughts -- I'd love to talk.  Maybe one day my writing career will take off! :)"
