i would close my blinds
in the room i called home
beige walls, crooked posters
but it was my world

i loved in that room
i escaped from this life
out was tranquil green and warm sun
but i cared none at all

now life is loud, and outside is chaos
but i look out nonetheless
i raise my blinds in great hope, but
the sun can't reach my windows here

when i was younger
the world was soft and sympathetic
now ive grown into the world
but it responds cold and decayed

the sun can't reach my windows here
i can't find peace anymore
i look out, and it'
i look in, and
