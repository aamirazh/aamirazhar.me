Finding my voice

I breathe in, and out. Words release themselves with me.
They drift atop the particles of the air, from my lungs to the world outside.
Like a cloud of breath on a cold day, my words take concrete shape only after I speak them.
Spoken doubtfully, strongly, petulantly, or sardonically, once said, my words become material, everlasting.

**But are my words mine?** Where are they created? How do they form? Why do I use them? I know not, yet I voice them nonetheless.

My lungs thrust my words forward, my tongue and lips shape their direction, but the words may come from origins unknown.

**If not I, then who speaks?**

At times, my trauma speaks, 

These words form narratives, grand stories. Words, the building blocks of doctrine, of dogma, of religion; words embed themselves into us, shape our convictions, tell us who we are.


**Then where is my voice?**

-Is it trauma speaking

My lungs are the mast through which my words embark, my tongue and lips the rudder that shape their direction. Yet my words are nothing more than a vessel, they are the object, acted upon but not acting itself.

At times, my will is weak. My mind lost, unsure. At these times, the winds and seas command my ship of words, my mind's captaincy folding to calamity.

Through violent storm or clear sky, I captain my ship. I own my words. I compose my story.

Words are my ship, and I control the seas.
