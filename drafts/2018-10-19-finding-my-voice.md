Finding my voice

I breathe in, and out, and words release themselves.
They pair with the particles of my breath, from my lungs to the world outside.
Like respiration transforming into a cloud on a cold day, the words take concrete shape only after I speak them.

Are these my words? Where are they created? How do they form? I know not, yet I speak nonetheless.

These words form narratives, grand stories. Words, the building blocks of doctrine, of dogma, of religion, words embed themselves into us, shape our convictions, most importantly tell us who we are.

We think our words are ours because we speak them. Yet our lungs are merely a vessel, they are not the rudder, nor our mouths the mast through which it embarks.

-Is it trauma speaking
