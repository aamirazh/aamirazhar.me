When I was in the middle of writing this piece on death, the news of the mosque shootings came out. It seems wherever I look nowadays

By the grace of God, I've never experienced a death of a close loved one in my life. I'm blessed to have lived 22 years without experiencing the death of any of my uncles, aunts, grandparents (my grandfather on my dad's side died long before I was born), friends, cousins, parents, siblings, you name it. I've been to a couple of funerals, but those were for extended family or distant family acquaintances, people I may have met once or twice when I was young, but no one I really knew. I've experienced my fair share of loss and trauma, but death still hasn't made its way into my life.

As such, I've never known how to think about death. It almost seems like an abstract concept to me. I mean, I think about death often, probably more than most. When I love someone, sometimes I wonder what it would be like to lose them, but I still can't sense exactly how it would feel. And when I am struggling in life, the thought of death makes its way into my mind frequently (at my lowest lows I've even had to call the suicide hotline a couple times), but its texture has always been one of fantasy and escapism rather than anything concrete, planned, or tangible. It always seems so distant. No matter how hard life gets, no matter how much worse I wonder it can get, I still don't know what it means to face death, either of yourself or of a loved one.

Experienced or not, it has become apparent to me lately that it is necessary to have a good relationship with death. Experiencing deep emotional turmoil the last 6 months, listening to my 88 year old grandmother who helped raise me talk about nearing the end of her life, reading accounts like *When Breath Becomes Air*, these have all brought and re-brought the question of life and death into my head. What does it mean to die? Conversely, what does it mean to live? Does the cycle of death suggest anything about life's meaning? What is loss, success, love, anything in a world where everything is temporary in the first place? Not just the institutions, expressions, and objects created, but the very beings experiencing them. All soon to become dust.

And if you look at our society, we

It seems apparent that we do not grow up with a healthy relationship with death. It seems the concept of death, at least in America, is always followed by some kind of pathos. When someone brings it up in conversation, the air feels heavier. When a speaker or pop psychologist talks about it, we feel motivated.

Now, I don't know what makes life meaningful. There are many schools of thought to explain life and death, thousands of years of philosophy put into addressing the temporality of life. You can be of the camp that believes the only true existence is the lived experience, that the individual's life should be enjoyed and fulfilled to its fullest. You could believe that we should strive to transcend ourselves, to leave behind a meaningful legacy, to worship the everlasting divine. You can believe some other combination, derivative, or divergent set of principles.

Regardless of it all, I assert that life is meaningful. There is inherent meaning in our lives. We may disagree on where exactly it comes from, and where it all leads, but it doesn't matter. It means something.

So let's

Now, there are multiple schools of thought around the meaning of life and death. Humans have been philosophizing about it practically since the beginning of time. As someone who loves philosophy, I'll spare you the boring details. However, in this blog post, I wanted to share two general approaches to death I've observed. Two different ways of coming to terms with the temporality of life.

The first approach, I would say, accepts the temporality, works in accordance to it. It says that we are going to die, so the only meaning is that which you construct, the only existence is this temporary life, and so it should be enjoyed and fulfilled to its fullest (which of course depends on your values).

The second tries to avoid it. It says that yes, life is temporary, so we should focus on ? Instead, we should strive to leave behind the greatest possible legacy, or we should worship the everlasting divine,

Some may see these as roughly likened to a more "individualist" perspective (valuing one's lived experience) vs a more "holistic" one (valuing a broader, universal sense of meaning), a more "Western" perspective vs a more "Eastern" one, a more "agnostic" perspective vs a more "religious" (or universal, spiritual) one. Of course, this is vastly oversimplified, and there's nothing saying the two are mutually exclusive.

Regardless,

Pop psychologists and motivational speakers love to use death as pathos. As a society, we dramatize death. When someone brings it up in conversation, the air feels heavier. When a leader talks about it, we feel more impassioned.

It's up to you what your approach and principles are. However,

we can only experience death once, yet it revolves around our lives

-mourn the death but treat the living and depressed bad
