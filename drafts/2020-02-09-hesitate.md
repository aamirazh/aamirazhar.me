8, 7, 10, five hundred twenty four
my voice is a tired one, my eyes still underdrawn
dreaming, romance, always wanting more
leaving, leaving, my heart is never sure

hestitate, don't hesitate, my body needs a home
recommit, i can't commit, i want to live it all
when i sigh, my body drops, my shoulders rise and fall
and when im stuck, between all or none, my soul may rip apart
