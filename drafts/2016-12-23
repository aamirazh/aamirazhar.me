the ash never clears

their blood never dries

yet we live like it will

yes, we live through these lies

we still try to fight

then stop, sigh, and leave

cause we choose to be fed

'fore we choose to be free

we already lost

least that's how we fight

will we give up and fade?

r'will we realize (?) our rights?
