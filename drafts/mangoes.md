Mangoes

-Haven’t had a mango for years (maybe leave this for later for piece development?) - 2014, when I was 17
-Source of pride among my friends (children of Pakistani and Indian immigrants)
-Only available to people who are willing to pay for expensive imported mangoes, or for people who go back
-Truth is, I haven’t had a mango for years, even though I take great pride in it, and ostracize those who don’t buy the hype
-I don’t even remember much about it. I had it when I was visiting as a kid (12?), and I knew they were hyped (my family talked a lot about it), but I really don’t remember much. I guess you don’t have the experience to make a judgment like that when you’re so young. But I liked it
-Haven’t been back to Pakistan since the last family wedding
-My family immigrated - once a few people immigrated, the rest of the family came (Pakistan families stay together)
-Only go back for weddings, and most of my older cousins have gotten married. My father is the youngest of his siblings (by 10 years), and now it’s my turn
--Some commentary on marriage pressure
-I’m also mixed race, so it’s hard to go back ‘home’ to two countries a year, so now we just go to Malaysia because there’s more family there
--Commentary on being mixed race
--Friends poke fun at me not being Malaysian or Pakistani enough, and I take it in stride, but it’s true. I haven’t been back to Pakistan in 5 years, haven’t had a mango since then
-Distance from mangoes, and from the cultural signifiers my father and family took stock in
--Will this distance increase? My family lives in America now, will we become more American as the generations progress? Will we still love mangoes?
--Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham, don't watch Bollywood movies anymore - I want to?
--Am I an impostor? Aren't we all?

It's a matter of pride.

Yes, a matter of pride. A matter of national and ethnic identity, a double braided, nylon rope holding us all together.

To denounce mangoes is to denounce our heritage, I would say. My childhood friends — a miscellaneous group of average brown boys growing up in San Jose — instilled this chauvinistic attitude towards mangoes in me, much more so than my family did. Some of us were Pakistani, some were Indian, but when it came to mangoes, those differences were as artificial as.. well, the borders they were founded upon. Even the non-South Asians in the group would join in from time to time. After all, Vietnamese, Malaysian, and Filipino mangoes have a reputation second only to their South Asian counterparts.

You could say us children of immigrants take food seriously, in a different way than our parents do. For our parents, a mango is a mango — the fuzzy fruit carries a full, juicy kind of sweetness missing from the superficial and flimsy sweets of America. (Do I sound biased? No matter.) But while our families adore mangoes, they are no more stuck-up about it than you are about your (I am about my?) favorite children's TV show. But us second-gen folks don't play games. Our nostalgia is scattered, at best, thus we fixate on these identity markers to strengthen our fragmentary connection to our homeland.

So when that one friend in our little squad says he thinks mangoes are overrated, we pounce on him. All of a sudden, his loyalties are called into question ("Always knew you wanted to be white.."), and his taste in food is discredited ("His opinion doesn't count, he hates mangoes"). The performative nature of identity shines most to me in these moments of half-serious jest.

Of course, not all of it is performative. Proximity to South Asian mangoes isn't arbitrary — in order to have access to them, you either have to visit "home" frequently enough, or you have to be willing to pay for mangoes imported to the US. Most recently immigrated families are too frugal to buy imported mangoes (or they think it's not the same), and the families that have been here longer don't have the same nostalgia for it. This means your love for mangoes really does represent how often you visit your homeland, and consequently your proximity to your culture.

Why we feel the need to flaunt a supposed cultural authenticity, and compete with each other on it, I don't entirely know. But needless to say, I join in the teasing; I even instigate it sometimes. Don't we all have our ways, healthy or not, of compensating for our vulnerable identities?

Now, I must confess: I haven't actually **had** a mango in forever. I only have a faint recollection as to how it tastes, the way it feels in my mouth. I haven't been back to Pakistan in over 5 years, yet I claim mangoes as my favorite fruit. Am I to blame? The last few times we went to Pakistan were for weddings, and most of my older cousins got married years ago. As the oldest child of my father, the youngest of his siblings by 10 years, I'm next in line. Given that there is absolutely no chance in hell I'm getting married anytime soon, it feels almost my own fault that I won't be tasting a mango in my foreseeable future. The next time I visit Pakistan, I will be an entirely different person than the 17 year old who visited last.

Being mixed doesn't help. My mom's side of the family is Malaysian, meaning every year, since my birth, we've had to choose which country to visit that year, if we travel at all. Pakistani families stay together, at all costs, so over time, everyone found a way to move to the US (even if it meant 3 families living in one house). Malaysian families, similar to Japanese people, stay in Malaysia, even if they do their undergrad in America. This means, the last 5 years, we have our Christmas breaks in Malaysia, not Pakistan. Of course, my brothers and I love Malaysia, and in many ways we prefer it. But to think, my younger brothers can barely remember Pakistan. My youngest brother has only been there once or twice, when he was a toddler. Is he as Pakistani as I am? Am I as Pakistani as my friends are?

So when my friends tease me about not being Pakistani or Malaysian enough, I take it. I take it, because it's true. I haven't watched a Bollywood since Obama was first elected. I can't speak Urdu to save my life, and my understanding is limited to what my uncle says before he gets impatient and starts speaking English to me. I am not fully Pakistani, I am not fully Malaysian, but, like, what percentage am I? Of course, I still identify as Malaysian, and I still identify as Pakistani. I still perform those identities, very much so. But how much of identity is performative and directional, and how much of is it active? How often must I visit these countries, eat their food, talk in their languages, understand their pop cultures, to be fully Pakistani or Malaysian? What is the formula? I **need** the formula, Batman!

I found out recently that one my friends goes home to China 3 or 4 times a year. 3 or 4 times? I envy those who visit their parents' homes often, and I wonder if they have more closure on their identity than I do. Being mixed doesn't help. My mom's side of the family is Malaysian, so every year, since I was born, we've had to choose which country to visit that year, if we travel at all. Pakistani families stay together, at all costs, so by now, most of my family is in the states. My uncles and dad's families, all 20 of us, stayed in the bay for 15 years. Malaysian families, much like Japanese people, stay in Malaysia, even if they study in America. And while most of my dad's side of the family came to America,

In the same way I tease my friend for not liking mango, I am teased for not being Pakistani or Malaysian enough. They joke, but it's true. How much of my identity is performative, definitional, and how much of it is "active"? Is this dichotomy of passive vs active identity fair? What even is identity? [need to flesh this out better]
