Why are all the wrong things temporary, and all the right things permanent?
* Temporary: Life itself, friendships, happiness
 * For example, whenever I experience something good, I know it will end. The memory lasts, but the happiness doesn't.
* Permanent: The decisions we have made in the past, our past experiences and how they affect who we are

The past is permanent, but the present is temporary. The future doesn't exist outside of our imagination.
* The past is too real. It is a constant.
* The future is in our heads. It is a dream.
* We are stuck between the past given to us (by our previous selves, who are not us right now, and by God, and history),
* and the future we dream of, but will never know, control, or touch.
* The present is all we have, but it is weak, brief, and fleeting.

Time is cruel to all people.
Its ways unintuitive, coarse, and cold.
Our bodies restricted, but time eternal, unable to reconcile.
Time and man, divorced and disjointed, yet integrated in circumstance.
Meld together by God's hand, an inhumane partnership.
Forced into intimacy until one meets its end.

To time, all is the past, and the past is all it provides.
To man, all is the present, and the present is all perceived.
The past, permanent, the present, passing.

This defective congregation, this broken marriage, bears a child of anxiety and grief.

For what is the future but a wraith [specter] for [hallucination of / vision of] the present?
And what is the past but a story imposed upon the present by the gods of our previous selves?
And what is the present but a half-born mutant, cemented between the two?

The past is eternal, the future nonexistent [a figment of our imagination], the present a short whiff of smoke.
We live a whiff of smoke, commanded by a past and future we could never touch.
