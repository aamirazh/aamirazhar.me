Thoughts and prayers are reactionary
We have our own way of dealing with trauma - established over thousands of years
Direct support is the easiest thing to turn to, and often the most intuitive, but many times it's not the answer
In fact, while it's the most satisfying to talk to your friend about their trauma, sometimes it ends up imposing emotional labor to the other person, they feel compelled to thank you, to make you feel validated, that you made a difference
The best way to help people is actually indirect: changing policy, organizing, having conversations with your family/friends behind closed doors
Indirect support is hard because there's no feedback mechanism, there is no one saying thank you (though you're also absolving them from providing emotional labor or validation)

But this doesn't mean to stay away from direct support entirely. In fact, what makes the most sense is to go through this process with the very people who are impacted by it. This way, the feedback mechanism works for everyone: you can be validated when you do good work, and those impacted can witness you doing it instead of only seeing you pop up right after a tragedy happens

Direct support: Reactionary, more fulfilling, interpersonal, potentially large change on a smaller scale
Indirect support: Proactive, more tedious, institutional, small change on a larger scale
