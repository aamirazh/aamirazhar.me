I had my midterm break last week, which actually ended up going really well. I went to Petra for 2 days, then Palestine for 4-5, and then had a day or two to relax before school started again. I walked an incredible amount during the break, averaging probably around 6-8 hours a day of just walking (we took no taxis in Palestine, unless it was between cities). This gave me a lot of time to reflect, to think about my anxiety and mental health, and of course to digest everything around me.

Palestine especially was a lot to digest, and not just in a political sense. And so, though I did made a lot of progress in terms of personal reflection, I wanted to share some of my thoughts and reflections from my short trip to Palestine. It's worth noting that I know absolutely nothing about the political situation or history of Palestine/Israel, and these are simply preliminary, personal observations during my less-than-a-week there.

## Jerusalem: Old City

So, we first arrived in Jerusalem during this trip. We stayed in a hostel in the old city. It ended up being one of my favorite cities I've ever visited, for a variety of reasons. There is just so much history, so much context, and so much human experience behind the city. And most importantly, it's very much alive. It's not like visiting the ruins of an ancient city (like Petra), and when learning about the history and context, you can very much see the reality it created.

Surprisingly, the largest impact Jerusalem 

_palestine
--jerusalem
-religion
-made me reconsider religiosity in a non-secular context
-seeing religion being a central part of people's lives, whereas in america it seems to be just an identity
-also learned more about Jewish history in israel/palestine
-ignorantly didn't know there was such an established jewish community here for so long, before israel was established
-so a lot of jews in israel aren't just from the holocaust, they have been in the middle east for a while
-jews do have a right to live in the middle east, it wasn't that they were just placed here
-subtle propaganda against islamic domination of jerusalem, even seemed pro-crusader at times

--ramallah
-palestinian culture
-went to a concert accidentally
-when approaching social issues, palestinians were very active and passionate
-they are very very resilient people
-have a rich culture outside of just the occupation, when we talk about palestine a lot of times it's in the context of the occupation but there's so much more

--nablus
-the occupation and relationship between israel and palestine
-saw this first hand and also talked to my friend about it
-he lived right next to an israeli settlement
-would be scared for his life sometimes
-couldnt walk in an area unless we were with him cuz foreigners at least made israeli police held more accountable
-his brother was assassinated by israeli police for being a communist/marxist rebel
-just random stuff i assume isn't assumed here
-realizing my american privilege
-friend is also applying to a lot of places to teach arabic (that's his passion), but no one wants to take him, despite him having qualifications
-studies at soaz, was a fulbright scholar, etc
-its such a simple dream too
-it's such a big problem
-the problem with the formation of israel was it imbalances jewish representation in the middle east
-first of all the creation of israel made middle eastern countries distrust jews
-and for jews, especially since they were being discriminated against, decided to go to israel, which seemed to be a safe haven just for them

-wanting to do something but feeling so hopeless
-stuck between feeling a responsibility to use my privilege to create structural change, and the realization that i can't really do much (in general)
