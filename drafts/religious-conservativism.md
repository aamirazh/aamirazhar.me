so in islam for example
theres stuff thats forbidden
but also stuff allowed
and it balances out right
like this is a bad example but like
sex before marriage forbidden, but u can get married early so thats the logic behind it
(it might not be, but thats just an example)
anyway
cuz of culture though, certain things become "forbidden" culturally
so e.g. consent with weddings, theres a lot of pressure from families
and with divorce, theres a lot of like "honor" involved even tho islam is supposed to make it easy and fair
so for example, in islam, if the woman wants to divorce, she has to pay back the dowry
if the guy wants to divorce, he just divorces (and doesnt get dowry back)
but in jordan for example, if the guy wants a divorce, cuz he doesnt wanna lose the dowry, he can treat the wife rly bad until she has to divorce and pay the dowry
stuff like that, like exploitation and loopholes - in a perfect "islamic" society, in that case, the woman can go to court and argue for a free divorce
but thats kinda looked down upon here (i think, not sure)
anyway the thesis is like
culture can make things forbidden (in addition to what religion makes forbidden), but it cant make more things acceptable as easily
so e.g. culture can make it so getting married before 22 is "forbidden", but its rly hard for a culture to make sex before marriage ok
cuz religion clearly dictates whats not ok, and just "assumes" certain freedoms
so what ends up happening is religion ends up being more conservative, since culture adds more forbidden things to religion but not more "accepted" things
