On Sunday morning at 11am, I left for the airport to start my trip to Tokyo. It was to be a long trip (20 hours of flying and an 8 hour layover), but I wasn't too worried. I liked flying (and transportation in general), and I was excited to start traveling.

The first flight, from SFO to Hong Kong, went by fairly fast, despite its length. Most people in the flight were (presumably) either Chinese-American people visiting family or Chinese people coming back from visiting family (or families with a mixture of both). I sat next to an old Chinese woman and her (presumably, again) husband or son.

I decided to sleep for the beginning of the 12 hour flight, to synchronize my sleep schedule with Japan's. I woke up to my tray table being pulled down. Turns out, I almost overslept the meal I was supposed to get, and the Chinese woman next to me was trying to put my meal on my tray without waking me up. Though I was startled at first, that was really nice of her and I thanked her.

The rest of the flight, post-meal, was pretty standard. I was randomly in the mood to listen to music and work, so I took advantage of that and finished a coding task I had to do for the economics research lab I'm helping out at. Then, I watched Kiki's Delivery Service for the first time. I think, by now, I've watched all the Miyazaki movies Studio Ghibli has produced. To be honest, though, while I love the movies, I think I still prefer more existential or sad movies. I still need to watch Grave of the Fireflies, which I'm sure I'd love.

Soon enough, we landed in Hong Kong for an 8 hour layover. In retrospect (and during the flight), I wished I talked to the Chinese woman next to me, but I get really lazy socially if I have no obligation. I think this is something I need to improve on. I always respect people who manage to interact with people from different backgrounds from them, and I hate tourism if it means segregating yourself from "locals", but because of a combination of introversion, language barrier, and a fear of inconveniencing others, I never really enact that myself.

The layover in Hong Kong was surprisingly tough. For one, I was too afraid to go up to the help desk because I wasn't sure if they spoke English.

Overall, I learned a lot in the past couple days. One, that I'm really lucky to know English. My social anxiety is already pretty bad now, but it would probably go through the roof if I spoke a language people weren't familiar with (and that wasn't imposed on the world through colonialism, Western capitalism, and imperialism, but I digress). Two, most people won't find it weird if you try to learn about their culture. I feel like that comes from my bias as an American - It would be actually annoying if I went up to Japanese-Americans trying to speak broken Japanese (instead of just speaking English) and asking questions about Japanese history or culture, largely because they're American. But, internationally, it might be a little different, and I've noticed people are more open to it. And lastly, I don't think I'll ever get over the awkwardness of the tourism dynamic. It almost is inherently off-putting for me, because of the power dynamic and the artificiality of tourism. It's always there, and I don't think there's a complete solution to it, or that we should be trying to brush it aside. It's probably just better to be aware of it to make sure you're at least acting ethically and within your boundaries as a tourist.
