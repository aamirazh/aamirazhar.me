As I open my eyes, the silhouette of my room slowly comes into view. Dawn still hasn’t hit, and it's almost pitch black. The only light source is the hallway light my dad leaves on that seeps through the foot of the door. I’m lying on my right side, but I decide to roll onto my back to relax and stare at the ceiling a bit. As I stare, my mind wanders, my eyes lose focus, and my sight fades to black again. I love that feeling. I drift away, and my mind forgets the difference between having eyes open and eyes closed. It forgets the difference between being awake and asleep. The difference between reality and dreams. Between life and death.

My phone vibrates on my desk. It's 6am, which means I need to get ready. I get out of my bed, and turn on the light. It's still dark outside, but I can tell sunrise will be soon. I change quickly, putting on the same blue jeans I wear every day, the same white socks I wear every day (okay, the same kind. I don't wear the same pair of socks every day), and a random shirt from my closet. This time, the shirt is red and says "Santa Clara County Fair 2014" on it. I remember going with my mom then. I was only 10 then. It was fun, but my dad couldn't go that day. My mom said he was busy, but when we came back, he was just watching TV. I stare at my t-shirt in the mirror and start to feel sad for a second, but I snap out of it and turn towards my door. Thankfully, my dad's room is on the other side of the house, and the kitchen is right next to my room. I walk quietly to the kitchen and pull out some cereal from the cupboard.

On the way to the fridge, I grab the remote and turn on the TV, muted of course. As I get the milk, bowl, and spoon, I keep my eye on the nature documentary rerun the TV was on. Dad must have been watching nature shows last night, or whatever was on this channel in the nighttime. Or he just switched to this before sleeping. Who knows.

It's almost 6:15 now. I switch to Cartoon Network and leave it on while I pour my cereal and milk. Commercials are playing right now. I eat quickly, but slow enough to time the meal with the end of the episode. Before I know it, it's 6:29, and the show finishes. I turn the TV off, sling my backpack around my shoulder, and head to the garage, where there's a side door I take to leave the house.

I walk out the side door, which places me right behind the garbage cans. I turn myself sideways to fit between them and the fence of the house next to me. After I get to the driveway, I do a quick scan of the neighborhood. It's still pretty dark outside, but it won't ever get brighter at 6:30 in the morning, given that it's smack in the middle of summer.  The sunlight is starting to spill over onto the sky, but I can't see the sun yet. My mom would probably say it's dangerous to walk by yourself with this little lighting, even just to school. I think about it in my head, and end up more or less agreeing with her. But, she's not here anymore, so I start trudging along.

My dad doesn't care, of course. Maybe he'd be happy if I got robbed. I think they have insurance for that kind of stuff, so he'd probably just pocket the money, even if it was mine they stole. Besides, he's the reason I have to leave so early for school in the first place. If I'm in the house when he wakes up, I risk a good beating if he wakes up on the wrong side of bed. At least if I'm not there, he just drinks and trashes the house, or actually sucks it up and goes to work.

The walk is pretty uneventful. There's a Chinese lady with a cart who walks the opposite direction as me every day. We do a little nod of acknowledgement to each other as we passed each other and go on our merry way. I do wonder what her story is, or what would happen if I tried talking to her. I Imagine the scenario in my head as I walk. Would she be friendly? She seems friendly enough, but maybe she wouldn't be in the mood to talk. Should I even assume she speaks English? What if she's this amazing retired celebrity who moved here to get away from living the high life? Suddenly, I arrive at the front of my school. I always forget how close it is, and how easily I lose myself in my thoughts while walking. The school bus doesn't even bother stopping by my neighborhood since all the kids just walk. Not that I would take it if it did.

I check my watch, and it's 6:40. Man, I think, I've gotten pretty good at maintaining this schedule. Probably because if I left any later, I'd risk getting beaten up. The administrators get in around 7 or 7:15, so I relax on the outside in the meantime. There's a faded wooden bench outside the gate facing the street, and I sit there, on the right side, waiting.  Like clockwork, at 6:45, Schellen sits down on the bench next to me, on the left side. I never notice where he comes from, and he manages to show up right when my mind starts drifting too far to pay close attention. This morning, I lost focus looking at this blue stone on the grass in front of me. But honestly, I'd never seen a stone so.. blue before. It shone a strong, smooth azure blue, and even though it was a gloomy day, it felt like the sun was reflecting off of it and the color was channeling straight into my eyes.

"Hey." I say

"Hey." he responds.

We normally don't say much. You lose stuff to talk about spending every day together, and me and Schellen are pretty reserved as it is. Come to think about it, we have pretty similar personalities. Maybe that's why we get along. So I continue to sit there, looking at the stone a bit more, trying to understand where the light came from. If I didn't have such bad eyesight, I would have thought it was coming directly from the rock itself.

"Where does color come from?" I ask Schellen.

"It comes from light itself. Light is like a wave and depending on the wavelength and frequency of the wave, your eyes interpret it as a certain color." he responds, sounding like my science teacher. He seems to know everything, though that doesn't mean I understand him all the time.

I don't really respond, or really understand, so I keep staring at this stone.

-Wake up at dawn to leave house before 7am to get to school before dad wakes up (abusive dad)
-While waiting for class at 8am, hang out with "friend" (don't really talk)
-He sits at back of class in corner
-After school, we go to the train tracks and walk on them
-Come back by 5pm to eat dinner
-Have fight with dad

Next day
-Similar routine, but very tired this day
-Try to focus when Schellen comes, lose sense of time, can't decipher my watch, feel delirious. He sits down and then I check watch and now I can read it (6:45)
-Can't say anything either, he mumbles a bit but I don't understand and I feel too tired to ask
-What was he even wearing tomorrow? Or any day? Everything is a blur
-...
-He convinces me to run away (?)
-Death (?)
