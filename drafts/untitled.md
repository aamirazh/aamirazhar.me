As I open my eyes, the silhouette of my room slowly comes into view. Dawn still hasn’t hit, and it's almost pitch black. The only light source is the hallway light my dad leaves on that seeps through the foot of the door. I’m lying on my right side, but I decide to roll onto my back to relax and stare at the ceiling a bit. As I stare, my mind wanders, my eyes lose focus, and my sight fades to black again. I love that feeling. I drift away, and my mind forgets the difference between having eyes open and eyes closed. It forgets the difference between being awake and asleep. The difference between reality and dreams. Between life and death.

My phone vibrates on my desk. It's 6am, which means I need to get ready. I get out of my bed, and turn on the light. It's still dark outside, but I can tell sunrise will be soon. I change quickly, putting on the same blue jeans I wear every day, the same white socks I wear every day (okay, the same kind. I don't wear the same pair of socks every day), and a random shirt from my closet. This time, the shirt is red and says "Santa Clara County Fair 2014" on it. I remember going with my mom then. I was only 10 then. It was fun, but my dad couldn't go that day. My mom said he was busy, but when we came back, he was just watching TV. I stare at my t-shirt in the mirror and start to miss my mom for a second, but I snap out of it and turn towards my door. Thankfully, my dad's room is on the other side of the house, and the kitchen is right next to my room, so I walk quietly to the kitchen and pull out some cereal from the cupboard.

On the way to the fridge, I grab the remote and turn on the TV, muted of course. As I get the milk, bowl, and spoon, I keep my eye on the nature documentary rerun the TV was on. Dad must have been watching nature shows last night, or whatever was on this channel in the nighttime. Or he just switched to this before sleeping. Who knows.

I switch to Cartoon Network and leave it on while I pour my cereal and milk. It's still on the commercial. I eat quickly
