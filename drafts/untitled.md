As I open my eyes, the silhouette of my room slowly comes into view. Dawn still hasn’t hit, and it's almost pitch black. The only light source is the hallway light my dad leaves on that seeps through the foot of the door. I’m lying on my right side, but I decide to roll onto my back to relax and stare at the ceiling a bit. As I stare, my mind wanders, my eyes lose focus, and my sight fades to black again. I love that feeling. I drift away, and my mind forgets the difference between having eyes open and eyes closed. It forgets the difference between being awake and asleep. The difference between reality and dreams. Between life and death.

My phone vibrates on my desk. It's 6am, which means I need to get ready. I get out of my bed, and turn on the light. It's still dark outside, but I can tell sunrise will be soon. I change quickly, putting on the same blue jeans I wear every day, the same white socks I wear every day (okay, the same kind. I don't wear the same pair of socks every day), and a random shirt from my closet. This time, the shirt is red and says "Santa Clara County Fair 2014" on it. I remember going with my mom then. I was only 9 then. It was fun, but my dad couldn't go that day. My mom said he was busy, but when we came back, he was just watching TV. I stare at my t-shirt in the mirror and start to feel sad for a second, but I snap out of it and turn towards my door. Thankfully, my dad's room is on the other side of the house, and the kitchen is right next to my room. I walk quietly to the kitchen and pull out some cereal from the cupboard.

On the way to the fridge, I grab the remote and turn on the TV, muted of course. As I get the milk, bowl, and spoon, I glance at the nature documentary rerun on TV. Dad must have been watching nature shows last night, or whatever was on this channel in the nighttime. Or he just switched to this before sleeping. Who knows.

It's almost 6:15 now. I switch to Cartoon Network and leave it on while I pour my cereal and milk. Commercials are playing right now. I eat quickly, but slow enough to time the meal with the end of the episode. Before I know it, it's 6:29, and the show finishes. I turn the TV off, sling my backpack around my shoulder, and head to the garage, where there's a side door I take to leave the house.

I walk out the side door, which places me right behind the garbage cans. I turn myself sideways to fit between them and the fence of the house next to me. I get to the driveway and do a quick scan of the neighborhood. It's still pretty dark outside, but it doesn't get brighter at 6:30 in the morning now that summer's begun.  The sunlight is starting to spill over onto the sky, but I can't see the sun yet. My mom would probably say it's dangerous to walk by yourself with this little lighting, even just to school. I think about it in my head, and end up more or less agreeing with her. But, she's not here anymore, so I trudge along.

My dad doesn't care, of course. Maybe he'd be happy if I got robbed. I think they have insurance for that kind of stuff, so he'd probably just pocket the money, even if it was mine they stole. Besides, he's the reason I have to leave so early for school in the first place. If I'm in the house when he wakes up, I risk a good beating if he wakes up on the wrong side of bed. At least if I'm not there, he just drinks and trashes the house. Sometimes he sucks it up and goes to work. Or he cleans up. I'm not there to tell, obviously.

The walk is pretty uneventful. There's a Chinese lady with a cart who walks the opposite direction as me every day. We do a little nod of acknowledgement to each other as we passed and go on our merry way. I do wonder what her story is, what would happen if I tried talking to her. I imagine the scenario in my head as I walk. Would she be friendly? She seems friendly enough, but maybe she wouldn't be in the mood to talk. Should I even assume she speaks English? Why does she leave her house at exactly 6:30am every day? Does she even have a house? I realize I think about this every day. Yet my behavior doesn't change. I then arrive at the front of my school. I always forget how close it is, and how easily I lose myself in my thoughts while walking. The same thoughts. The school bus doesn't even bother stopping by my neighborhood since all the kids just walk. Not that I would take it if it did.

I check my watch, and it's 6:40. Man, I think, I've gotten pretty good at maintaining this schedule. Probably because if I left any later, I'd risk an injury. The administrators get in around 7 or 7:15, so I relax on the outside in the meantime. There's a faded wooden bench outside the gate facing the street, and I sit there, on the right side, waiting.  Like clockwork, at 6:45, Schellen sits down on the bench next to me, on the left side. He's wearing a vest over a v-neck, baggy jeans, and some Reeboks. I never notice where he comes from, and he manages to show up right when my mind starts drifting too far to pay close attention. This morning, I lost focus looking at this blue stone on the grass in front of me. To be fair, I'd never seen a stone so blue before. It shone a strong, smooth azure blue, and even though it was a gloomy day, it felt like the sun was reflecting off of it and the color was channeling straight into my eyes.

"Hey." I say

"Hey." he responds.

We normally don't say much. You lose things to talk about when you spend every day with someone, and me and Schellen are pretty reserved as it is. I mean, we have pretty similar personalities. Maybe that's why we get along. So I continue to sit there, looking at the stone a bit more, trying to understand where the light came from. My bad eyesight made it seem like it was coming directly from the rock itself.

"Where does color come from?" I ask Schellen.

"It comes from light itself. Light is like a wave and depending on the wavelength and frequency of the wave, your eyes interpret it as a certain color." he responds, sounding like my science teacher. He seems to know everything, though that doesn't mean I understand him all the time.

I don't really respond, or really understand, so I keep staring at this stone. Time passes inconspicuously again, and it's 7:15 now. Ms. Patel opens the gate, and we walk in. We make our way between the boring beige walls of the hallway to classroom 8.2. Class starts at 8, and there's 45 minutes, so I walk up to my desk, put my backpack on the floor, sit on my chair, and pull out my DS and start playing.

"You know, you should consider reading before school starts. You get in so early, you could probably get through a whole book a week." Ms. Caldstone says. She's sitting behind her also boring and beige desk. She's wearing a grey blazer of sorts over a white top, her hair tied back as always. She looks sort of different without glasses, but I imagine it's much more convenient to wear contacts instead. "Have you even done your homework?"

"Yes, Ms. Caldstone." I say sheepishly. I haven't finished everything, but I do all my homework in math class anyway.

I go back to playing my DS. I'm playing the newest (but kinda old) Pokemon game, Pokemon Ultra Moon. I've almost reached the big fight with Necrozma, and I'm trying to get there before school starts.

Unfortunately, I make very little progress before the school bell rings at 7:55. I feel like I've only played for a few minutes, which I chalk up to video game immersion. Almost all at once, the rest of the class pours in. My desk is near the front, on the left side of the second out of five rows with five desks each. Schellen sits at the back, in the bottom left corner. People barely notice he's there, especially since he never talks. Even the teachers never ask him questions.

Class goes by extremely slowly. I find myself resisting the urge to look at the clock, then giving up after 20 minutes, only to find out that just two minutes had passed. Somehow, I get through most of my morning classes. English, Math and Social Studies. All that's left is Art, and then I finally get my lunch break. Art is my favorite subject this year. Part of the reason is because it's right before lunch, so it ends on a nice note. Another reason is because the teacher, Mr. Garcia, is so chill. He lets us do whatever we want as long as we present our progress to the class every other week. Two people present every day, at the beginning of class, for 5 minutes each, and we get the rest of class to do whatever we want.

Today, I decide to start painting a new art piece. I have this urge to paint a burnt orange bridge on the outskirts of town. I only went there once, years ago, two weeks before mom died. We rode a canoe together on the river under the bridge. It was hard to get there, since there was only one makeshift dock on the side of the river, and it was only accessible from the ladder that went down one of the bridge's piers. People stopped going there, though. Apparently someone got hurt going down the ladder, and since then, the city remodeled the bridge and closed down all activities on and around the river. I wonder if anyone goes down the bridge's walkway just to see the river, even though you can't experience it. It was a beautiful river, and canoeing down it remains one of my fondest memories with mom.

I sit there quietly, painting this bridge, uncovering this itch I have. As always, when I paint, I feel entirely at peace, like the trials of my life are no more. I love painting because when I paint a new universe, it replaces the current one I am experiencing (apparently, two universes cannot exist simultaneously). I would lose myself in trying to understand and discover what this world is, how it feels, for what purpose it exists. Finishing almost feels unscrupulous, as I am immediately transported back to the realm of the disappointing 'real'. While I always long for the feeling of excavating an unknown world, after painting, I manage to return to my world with a refreshed desire to explore and unearth the mysteries of this world as well. Our universe remains an inefficient, inequitable, insufferable creation, but it has one unique (even redeeming) quality: it continues to live, and it demands to be experienced.

No matter how hard I try, after finishing, I am never able to return to a universe I have created, to experience the sensation I had when creating it. It seems that the realm of dreams, of fantasy, of art, and the realm of reality, have been built to be separate, and mutually exclusive. Similarly, "the sensation" has been so absent from this universe, that often in the redundancy of daily life, I find myself yearning to find it in this world. The dream realm is ethereal, but temporary; the real world mundane, but persistent. To this day, I have not felt true beauty in this world. I only feel it in worlds other than our own.

This is the first time I draw an object existing in this 'real' realm, this bridge and its surrounding area. Though I've drawn realistic environments before, they would still be fabricated to a point, like a generic landscape of rural America, or a busy city view of a street in Manhattan (where I've never been). Most of my paintings *seem* real, but they are fictional. This painting is real, but it *seems* fictional. The colors are off, almost inverted, the bridge a boring light blue, while the river and sky bleed a tainted, dark orange. There is nothing else in the painting besides the sky, bridge, and river, except a rippled circle of black on the river, directly under the railing of the bridge. I don't know what it means, or why it's there, but I felt compelled to paint it.

The rest of the day goes by quickly, thank God. Once I finish my painting, I immediately snap out of my dream, and the rest of the day becomes some kind of a simulation. Maybe I haven't returned from the dream entirely, but either way, at least it goes fast and not slow like this morning. I'm not complaining, but it is annoying that I have to go home soon.

The school bell rings at 3, signaling the end of what I consider the normal part of the day. Now, I have an hour and a half before I have to be home.

Schellen and I decide to walk down the train tracks again. Maybe this time, we'll actually be able to see a train pass by, I think. I mean, assuming they still run. As we walk towards the train tracks, we witness the city get more and more rundown. Is there something about train tracks that make the surrounding area poorer? Or is it a coincidence?

"What do you think, Schellen?"

"Maybe it has something to do with the accessibility of train tracks back when passenger trains still ran here. Richer people probably had cars, or didn't work at all, so they never found it useful to be close to the stations. Poor people probably needed it to get to work every day."

"Oh. Cool." I say, slightly understanding. "Wish I paid attention in history."

Schellen and I walk down the tracks, strolling further from home each step we take. The surrounding area is not very lively. All I can see around me are abandoned houses, empty warehouses, and broken shacks. Soon enough, the sun starts to drift towards the land, as if it is tired after a long day, wishing to return to its repose under the heavy blanket of the Earth. As we walk further down, I notice more and more of the buildings are painted a faded light blue. I wonder what made everyone in the area paint their places light blue years ago.

"You'd think, in an area like this, people wouldn't have painted their houses like this. Odd." Schellen remarks.

As we continue down the tracks, it feels more and more like I've stepped into an alternate world. Schellen and I have walked down these tracks before, but we've never seen any blue houses, nor has it been as quiet as it is now. Or, it's always been quiet here, but now, it's *still*. It feels like nothing around me is moving except for me and Schellen. Like everything in the world is stuck in time except for us. Oddly enough, I find this feeling encouraging, so I march onto the horizon, towards the dark, burnt orange light of the almost-setting sun. I march, and I keep marching.

When the bottom of the sun hits the horizon, I realize it must be getting late. Judging by our proximity to sunset, it may already be past 5. I need to get home, and it seems I'm really far as it is. I look to my right and left, and **all** of the buildings are faded light blue at this point. It's uncanny. Unsettling.

I stop, and start to turn towards the opposite direction. Before I finish turning, I hear a sound, the first sound I've heard since stepping on these tracks today. It sounds like.. steam of some sort.

The train cruises towards us at a surprisingly swift pace. Its hull shines a golden orange, while the machine releases silver steam with a metallic, bluish tint. The train seems to shine bright, as if it is reflecting sunlight that has long since left the sky. But when I look closely, I see that the metal is dull and faded. It feels surreal and real all at once.

Still hypnotized by the mirage, I stand unwittingly on the tracks, as time (or just the train, I can't tell) slows down gradually. Each second, as the train inches forward, its proximity to me becomes more and more apparent, and my subconscious starts to fire warning signs. I can almost feel the synapses trying to jumpstart my mind into action. Yet I remain still. The train is real, but I have this *intuition* that it will do nothing but pass through me. Like its material is not metal, but indiscriminate particles of light that came together to form this illusion of an orange-ish train, only to dissipate into nothingness soon thereafter. This image implants itself into my head, and as the train gets closer, the image becomes clearer, until it's all I can feel. Until the fantasticality of it all becomes a part of me.

I've felt pain. Every week, almost every other day, I feel pain. I feel the sting of my father's palm on my cheek, the dense throbbing of my blood vessels repelling the hard, cylindrical cardboard container, a container which would store the research posters my father used to present at his conferences, conferences which would distract my father for weeks, weeks which would cede me and my mother a peaceful purgatory until he returned.

But the bruises and blood left on the skin are incomparable to the scars and trauma left on the heart. The pain of abuse is not physical. It is emotional. It stings not at the skin, but deeper, in the soul. Physical pain comes from the outside and stops at the skin, at your blood. Emotional pain originates from your heart and spreads outward to your soul, mind, and body. It engulfs you.

"Yo, snap out of it." Schellen pulls me from the train track a second before the train takes my place, despite my readiness to be swallowed up in its image.




-Wake up at dawn to leave house before 7am to get to school before dad wakes up (abusive dad)
-While waiting for class at 8am, hang out with "friend" (don't really talk)
-He sits at back of class in corner
-Draw bridge
-Feel urge to draw something at the bottom of the bridge, maybe some colors, or my mom, idk
--Spot of black: Happens on accident? Or I don't notice? Or I just do it unconsciously?
-After school, do something with Schellen, lose track of time, get home late
-Come back by 5pm to eat dinner
-Have fight with dad

Next day
-Similar routine, but very tired this day
-Try to focus when Schellen comes, lose sense of time, can't decipher my watch, feel delirious. He sits down and then I check watch and now I can read it (6:45)
-Can't say anything either, he mumbles a bit but I don't understand and I feel too tired to ask
-What was he even wearing tomorrow? Or any day? Everything is a blur
-...
-He convinces me to run away (?)
-Death (?) (screaming out "mom" while falling? looking towards sky, falling towards river, they seem dark orange)
-Schellen a ghost of mom?
--Or maybe Schellen just a dark second personality that came after mom left

Themes
-Color. Abnormal things are bright, everything else is beige or boring
-Time. Time passes oddly, most of the time he loses track of it
